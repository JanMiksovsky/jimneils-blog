<p>Here’s <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/filler-content-tools-tips-and-a-dynamic-example/">a link</a> to my most recent article. I talk about how to leverage filler content in your design process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of website design used to take place in Photoshop, manually copying/pasting text from the web was the best method for ‘filling in’ a design with dummy content. However, now that a lot of website design takes place in the browser, why not have the computer do all ‘filling in’ work for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a new era for designing in the browser. See how by reading <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/filler-content-tools-tips-and-a-dynamic-example/">Filler Content: Tools, Tips and a Dynamic Example</a>.</p>

        <p>Have you ever felt exhausted by infinite scrolling?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infinite scrolling merely tempts you to continue reading, wasting time and decreasing productivity in the process ... Even more annoying is that scroll bars do not reflect the actual amount of data available. You’ll scroll down happily assuming you are close to the bottom, which by itself tempts you to scroll that little bit more, only to find that the results have just doubled by the time you get there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered this many times. It&#39;s exhausting. The worst part is that you keep telling yourself “just a little further” because you perpetually see the scroll bar two-thirds of the way down the page and don&#39;t want to feel as though you&#39;re missing out on any information.</p>

<p>Yogev Ahuvia wrote <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/03/infinite-scrolling-get-bottom/">a great article over at Smashing Magazine</a> that analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using infinite scrolling. It&#39;s worth a read. </p>

        <p>Establishing a grid is a great way to organize and structure design elements. In addition, by breaking the organization and structure of the grid you can emphasize visual relationships between design elements.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks to Grids</h2>

<p>Recently I came across a subtle and often overlooked side-effect of grid-based design: unintended visual relationships. An example of this can be found in the Wordpress theme <a href="http://wpshower.com/themes/portfolium/">Portfolium</a> </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium.jpg" alt="Portfolium Screenshot"></p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a well executed grid-based design: organized and structured; however, the alignment of the navigation to the thumbnail grid suggests visual relationships that are nonexistent. </p>

<p>For example, take a look at the words at the top of the page: they align to the thumbnail grid. This suggests a columnar relationship between each navigation item and the thumbnails  below them. However, no such relationship actually exists.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-grid-alignment.jpg" alt="Portfolium Grid Alignment"></p>

<h2>Rows, Columns, or Neither?</h2>

<p>This type of unintended visual alignment is confusing. The words in the navigation align with the columns below them, suggesting some type of organization or categorization. Even the light grey lines below navigation item are visually separated which helps reinforce the idea of a column layout. Even so, there is no relationship between the navigation items and the thumbnails below them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you wanted to suggest a relationship between the navigation items and the thumbnails below them, the alignment of Portfolium would be ideal. For example, if you wanted to separate and categorize the thumbnails by column, this type of alignment would work very well:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-categories.jpg" alt="Portfolium Categories"></p>

<h2>A Better Alignment</h2>

<p>In the example of Portfolium, not aligning the navigation to the thumbnail grid would break the grid and provide a visual separation between the sections of image thumbnails and navigation. In addition, making the light grey line at the top a solid, unbroken line helps visually separate the header from the content.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-new.jpg" alt="Altered Portfolium Screenshot"></p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the creators of Portfolium had a purpose in mind when designing the theme the way they did. However, I don&#39;t see it. Take care to always be aware of how your grid elements are being aligned. In grid-based design, it&#39;s easy to unintentionally suggest visual relationship that don&#39;t exist.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>I have a confession: for some time now I&#39;ve been cynical of art. More specifically modern art. For example, here is a piece of art I encountered at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City: </p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-wPHGACcAA7xOB.jpg" alt="Modern Art at the MoMA"></p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but ask myself: how is this art? Even more puzzling: how does it have a place in the world-renowned MoMA? At first-glance, this piece seems on par with something my four-year-old nephew could create. Then, as a web designer, I am reminded most people think websites are something their nephews could create too. </p>

<p>What&#39;s my point? I realize I don&#39;t understand or appreciate art because I am ignorant of it. People don&#39;t understand or appreciate web design because they are ignorant of it. As a general rule of thumb, the more you immerse yourself in something and learn its intricacies and rationales the more you come to appreciate and respect it. That goes for modern art or web design. Get to know the things you criticize. Generally, <strong>the more you know the less you will criticize</strong>.</p>

<h2>So Is It Art or Not?</h2>

<p>The question still remains, what is art? Is that scribbled piece of canvas art? Here&#39;s a tip from Milton Glaser, a celebrated graphic designer, on determining what is and is not art:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you cannot tell art by virtue of medium, or function, or anything else except by the fact of its raising your consciousness to a degree that you are attentive. And so if something produces the state of attentiveness, whether it’s a drawing, or a guy making a cheese sandwich, we can call it art, at least by my description</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Glaser, if something &quot;produces a state of attentiveness&quot;, whether it&#39;s Van Gogh&#39;s <em>Starry Night</em> or this seemingly scribbled mess, you can call it art.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, that scribbled mess at the MoMA brought me an incredible amount of introspection and reflection. It raised my consciousness to a degree that I was attentive. I suppose that is why it has a place at the Museum of Modern &quot;Art&quot;.</p>

        <p>I recently participated in the <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/hackathon/2012/">Arc90 Hackathon</a>. I originally volunteered for a different project as part of a team, but due to scheduling conflicts my team disbanded. I was left with the option to work on a solo project, which resulted in <a href="http://teamcolors.arc90.com/">Team Colors</a>: a single-page website that serves as a reference for HEX values for professional sport teams:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/team-colors.png" alt="Screenshot of Team Colors, an Arc90 Hackathon Project"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Hackathon took place while I was absent from the office (travelling to Utah for the Christmas break). So a lot of my work was done on a plane and working from home. I started Team Colors by sketching out some ideas for the page hierarchy and navigation:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/team-colors-sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of Team Colors"></p>

<p>After thinking through and sketching out how to present each team and its corresponding brand colors in a responsive manner, I turned to writing some pseudocode that would power the interaction of the site:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/team-colors-code.jpg" alt="Pseudocode for Team Colors"></p>

<p>Once I got everything down on paper, the fun part of building began. The hardest part was  finding the actual HEX values for each team. There were some obscure, outdated forum posts scattered across the web. In the end Wikiepedia was my best reference, although it did not provide the brand colors in the user interface. I found them in the underlying HTML/CSS using Chrome developer tools.</p>

<h2>Technical Overview</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick overview of the technology used:</p>

<ul>
<li>The page is responsive, built using HTML5, CSS, and the CSS preprocessor Compass</li>
<li>All the data (team names, hex values) is stored in a single JSON file. This makes updating the page quite simple. You just add a new league with teams, or a new team in the appropriate league with its corresponding HEX values. Then add the team&#39;s logo into the images directory and you&#39;re done!</li>
<li>Most team logos are SVGs, making them crisp on HiDPI devices. If a team logo isn&#39;t avaiable in SVG, a PNG fallback is used. </li>
<li>Progressive enhancement is used thoroughly:

<ul>
<li>Images are served by javascript after page load to reduce HTTP requests on the initial page load</li>
<li>All league/team data is loaded in a single page. Javasript is used to create a the drop-down control for sifting through teams by league and showing/hiding content.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
