        <p>Can you really change the world over night?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In both the web and in our greater community, I see people despair that change doesn’t happen more quickly. That we can’t make the world better overnight. But if this year has taught me anything, it is that we can’t ignore the hard work that needs to be done. And that we all must take up the charge to make the world better than it we found it — both on the web and in our society. - <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/what-we-learned-in-2012">Jason Grigsby</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is so great about the web is that , with a single great idea, you <strong>can</strong> often build it overnight. Or at least in a few days. No bureaucracy. No paperwork. No meetings. No board approval.The <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/hackathon/2012/">Arc90 Hackathon</a> was a good example of this to me.  Get a good idea, start a conversation, excite others, build it, release it to the community, and if its great, you&#39;ll begin sowing the seeds of change. </p>

<p>From there you just iterate.  </p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I needed a star symbol in my design. That&#39;s how this all started. I wanted to use something other than an image to display the star on screen for various reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I wanted the star to be different colors in different contexts and I didn&#39;t want to create an image of the star for each variance. </li>
<li>I wanted the star to be crisp and clear, which meant I&#39;d have to create multiple sizes of the image for retina screen support.</li>
</ol>

<p>So rather than create a handful of stars as images (in different colors and sizes) I decided to try using the black star symbol in Unicode (U+2605, &amp;#9733).</p>

<h2>Unicode and Font Stack Correlations</h2>

<p>I began by simply inserting the character reference in my markup with the default CSS font-size of 1em and font stack of Helvetica. However, I stumbled on an inconsistency in modern browsers: the unicode star was rendering at different sizes in browsers that implement different rendering engines.</p>

<p><img src="http://jim-nielsen.com/images/2013/black-star-unicode-arial-helvetica.png" alt="Black Star Unicode Using Helvetica and Arial Unicode MS"></p>

<p>Notice the size difference? It appears the black star unicode symbol is not supported by my default stack of Helvetica. In order to display the character, each browser is resorting to a font of it&#39;s own choosing that <em>does</em> support it. In this case, each browsers is choosing a different font; hence the size discrepancy. </p>

<p>By resorting to a font stack that supports the black star glyph (in this case Arial Unicode MS), I achieved consistent sizing across browsers. You can see the differences and similarities in this blown up photo:</p>

<p><img src="http://jim-nielsen.com/images/2013/black-star-unicode-arial-helvetica-zoomed.png" alt="Zoomed in Photo of Black Star Unicode Glyph"></p>

<h2>But Wait, There&#39;s Always IE</h2>

<p>Of course, if you&#39;re trying to support IE, throw everything I just said out the window. The black star wasn&#39;t displaying in IE 7 &amp; 8 on Windows XP. This is because Windows XP, by default, didn&#39;t have a font that supports the black star glyph using standard Unicode. However, if the user had additional fonts installed, like the ones that come with MS Office, I&#39;m guessing this technique would probably work. I&#39;ll leave that up to someone else to test.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re going to use Unicode symbols, make sure you&#39;re using a font that supports them. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll find some strange inconsistencies across browsers. Here is Wikipedia&#39;s take:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Miscellaneous Symbols Unicode block (2600–26FF) contains various glyphs representing things from a variety of categories …  these [characters] may not display properly if your computer does not implement Unicode and have the proper fonts installed. Also, some browsers may not display certain symbols properly at all even if your computer has the required implemented Unicode and fonts. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started realizing consistent Unicode support across browsers and platforms was a rabbit&#39;s hole I didn&#39;t want to go down any further. So I switched my implementation technique to <a href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/">icon fonts</a>, which was much more bullet-proof.</p>

        <p>Jon Tan, in a <a href="http://24ways.org/2012/science/">recent article at 24 Ways</a>, talks about the science behind the positive effects of good typography. In his article, he references a study by Dr Kevin Larson of Microsoft and Dr Rosalind Picard of MIT that explored the effects of good typography on mood: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two versions of the New Yorker ePeriodical were created. One was typeset well and the other poorly … [the doctors] engaged twenty volunteers — half male, half female — and showed the good version to half of the participants. The other half saw the poor version. The doctors found that, “there are important differences between good and poor typography that appear to have little effect on common performance measures such as reading speed and comprehension.” In short, good typography didn’t help people read faster or comprehend better … [the doctors] also found that “the participants who received the good typography performed better on relative subjective duration and on certain cognitive tasks”, and that “good typography induces a good mood.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, between the volunteers who read the bad typographyical layout and those that read the good typographographical layout, there were no differences in reading speed or comprehension. However, those volunteers who read the good typographical layout <em>perceived</em> it as an easier task and were induced to a good mood.</p>

<p>It can thus be inferred that setting type without regard to contrast, font size, kearning, leading, and so forth, is still functional. It still works. People can still read bad typographic layouts without much difference in &quot;reading speed and comprehension&quot;.</p>

<p>Hence, taking the time to incorporate principles of good typography in your designs won&#39;t necessarily improve readers&#39; comprehension. It will, however, leave people feeling good (though they may not know why). And as web designers, that is a goal worth striving for! We are not creating software. We are not making things beautiful. <strong>We are designing experiences.</strong> Expereinces that leave people feeling good.</p>

<p>And if inducing a good mood isn&#39;t reason enough to invest in good typography, the study also proved that good typography made people &quot;more capable of completeing creative tasks faster&quot;. </p>

<p>So if your app helps people accomplish tasks, especially creative ones, you had better consider the positive effects of great typography!</p>
