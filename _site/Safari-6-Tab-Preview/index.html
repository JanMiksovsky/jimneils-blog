<p>Title: Safari 6 Tab Preview: Show Me More! (In Quantity, Not Size)
Date: 2012-11-30
Excerpt: The new tab preview experience in Safari 6 might be better if it <em>revealed more</em> of the tab previews as it grows horizontally rather than increasing the size of the tab previews. </p>

<p>Apple&#39;s Safari 6 introduced a new tab switching experience. By activating the feature, Safari presents you with a bird&#39;s-eye view of open tabs. 100% of the active tab is previewable while only about 15% of it&#39;s left and right sibilings are previeweable.</p>

<p>This experience of previewing your tabs is consistent no matter the application&#39;s viewport size. You always see 100% of the active tab and about 15% of it&#39;s left and right siblings.</p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to see the preview of the active tab&#39;s sibilings grow as the viewport grows horizontally? Essentially, if I had a large monitor I would be able to <strong>see more</strong> of the sibling tabs&#39; previews.</p>

<p>As you can see, as the window grows in size horizontally it would <strong>reveal more</strong> of the sibilng tabs&#39; previews <strong>rather than increase</strong> the tab preview sizes. Visually this would help form a more cohesive mental model of the spacial relationship between tabs. It would also help tremendously for any site-comparison a user might be doing.</p>
