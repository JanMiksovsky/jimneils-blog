    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Neil Postman, in his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Technopoly-The-Surrender-Culture-Technology/dp/0679745408">Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology</a></em>, tells the story of how advertisers in the late 1800&#39;s began to realize marketing products isn&#39;t about extolling the benefits of the products themselves. Rather, effective advertising is, as Postman remarks, about using the persuasive power of language and photographs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Advertising is most effective when it is irrational. By irrational, I do not, of course, mean crazy. I mean that products [can] best be sold by exploiting the magical and even poetical powers of language and pictures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Postman uses the word &quot;irrational&quot; to reveal how advertisers previously employed logic and reason to sell products. However, they soon realized that compelling language and photographs were more powerful in consumers&#39; minds than logic and reason; hence the irrationality of advertising:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the turn of the century, advertisers no longer assumed that reason was the best instrument for the communication of commercial products and ideas. Advertising became one part depth psychology, one part aesthetic theory. In the process, a fundamental principle of capitalist ideology was rejected: namely, that the producer and consumer were engaged in a rational enterprise in which consumers made choices on the basis of a careful consideration of the quality of a product and their own self-interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rejection of rationality in consumer enterprise led to the type of advertising we have today, where commercials and ads aren&#39;t about the products being sold but rather the character of the consumers viewing the ad:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, the television commercial, for example, is rarely about the character of the products. It is about the character of the consumers of products. Images of movie stars and famous athletes, of serene lakes and macho fishing trips, of elegant dinners and romantic interludes, of happy families packing their station wagons for a picnic in the country — these tell nothing about the products being sold. But they tell everything about the fears, fancies, and dreams of those who might buy them. <strong>What the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer.</strong> And so the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research, <strong>which means orienting business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable.</strong> The business of business becomes pseudo-therapy; the consumer, a patient reassured by psychodramas. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

        <p>Take a look at this:</p>

<p><code>*</code></p>

<p>In CSS terms, that&#39;s the universal selector. Are warning sirens relating to performance sounding in your head? Are you feeling emotions of avoidance, like you do when you see <code>!important</code>? It&#39;s possible you do. The universal selector carries a negative stigma of poor performance. But should it? <a href="http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/">Paul Irish answers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently you’ve heard its slow. Firstly, it’s not. It is as fast as <code>h1</code> as a selector. It can be slow when you specifically use it like <code>.foo &gt;</code> , so don’t do that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be slow, but mostly it&#39;s not. Still, that may seem like reason enough in your mind to avoid using (or misusing) it. Stop thinking that way. Turn those &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger,_Will_Robinson">Danger, Will Robison!</a>&quot; sirens off. Don&#39;t be afraid to use it. Why? Paul Irish continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to care about the performance of <code>*</code> unless you concatenate all your javascript, have it at the bottom, minify your css and js, gzip all your assets, and losslessly compress all your images.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember that general rules of thumb, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>don&#39;t use the <code>*</code> selector, it&#39;s slow</li>
<li>don&#39;t use the <code>!important</code> rule</li>
</ul>

<p>are rules discovered and shared by developers working on immensely large scale applications and websites, like Google.com. Some rules just don&#39;t apply to your ten page Wordpress site. </p>

<p>The <code>*</code> and <code>!important</code> rules were invented for a reason. If you find yourself needing them, use them. That&#39;s what they were made for. If page performance takes a hit, look into larger-scale optimization techniques first, such as image optimization and concatenation. After that, you can get down to the nit-picky. In general, <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/css-selector-performance-has-changed-for-the-better/">optimization of selectors should be the job of the rendering engine</a>, not the designer.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>I was trying to import a SQL database into a local copy of Wordpress. The SQL file was larger than the standard 2MB upload limit, so Wordpress wouldn&#39;t let me upload it. </p>

<p>After some research, I realized I could change the <code>max_upload_filesize</code> in the <code>php.ini</code> file. However, after changing the value to 10MB, Wordpress was still indicating the prior upload limit of 2MB. After wasting time trying other fixes, I suddenly realized I had not restarted apache!</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/duh.gif" alt="Duh!"></p>

<p>From the command line <code>sudo apachectl restart</code> restarted my local apache server and changed my upload limit to 10MB in Wordpress.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: if you&#39;re tinkering in configuration files, don&#39;t forget to restart apache to see your changes!</p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content

    <div class="content">
        <p>I recently redesigned my wordpress theme for <a href="http://iosicongallery.com">iOS Icon Gallery</a> and <a href="http://macicongallery.com">Mac Icon Gallery</a>. </p>

<p>The old themes provided the ability to comment through the interface. Due to a lack of real comments and a surplus in spam comments, I decided to entirely remove the ability to comment from the interface. </p>

<h2>Removing the Ability to Comment From the Interface Is Not Enough to Keep Out Spam</h2>

<p>Once my theme went live, I was still getting spam comments in the Wordpress backend. I asked myself, &quot;how are comments still appearing in the Wordpress backend when I don&#39;t have a single comment form on my website?&quot; After some Googling, I discovered this was due to spambots posting data directly using <code>wp-comments-post.php</code>. </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/sneaky.gif" alt="Sneaky Gif"></p>

<h2>Further Stopping Spambots</h2>

<p>To prevent spambots from posting to Wordpress via a URL, you can block access to <code>wp-comments-post.php</code> via the <code>.htaccess</code> file. Simply include these rules in your <code>.htaccess</code> file (thanks to <a href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/snippets/blockreduce-wordpress-spam-comments-via-htaccess">catswhocode</a>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .wp-comments-post.php*
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !.*yourdomainname.* [OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$
    RewriteRule (.*) ^http://%{REMOTE_ADDR}/$ [R=301,L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to change the <code>yourdomainname</code> part!</p>

<h2>That Doesn&#39;t Help You?</h2>
