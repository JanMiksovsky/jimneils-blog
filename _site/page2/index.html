<p>This is not a watered down version of the internet. Or the “mobile” version of the internet. Or the “kinda-sorta looks like the internet” internet. It’s just the internet. On your phone.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="blog/assets/img/2013/iphone-commercial.jpg" alt="iPhone internet TV ad screenshot"></p>

<p>Those are the words from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldjHqHC6szA">2007 TV ad</a> showcasing the capabilities of Apple’s new iPhone which allowed you to browse the internet. Not the stripped-down version so many PDAs and other mobile devices were accessing at the time, but the real internet. The same internet you saw on your desktop computer. That was revolutionary.</p>

<p>Why? People want the web to be universal. They want the same internet they use everywhere else. They want to see and do the same things on their mobile device that they see and do on their desktop at home. So next time you think about stripping a feature from your responsive website or creating an entirely different “mobile-optimized” version of it remember this ad. </p>

<p>I‘d venture to say that most people would rather double tap and two-finger pinch their way around the “desktop” web than be short-changed on content or capabilities for a “mobile-optimized” web.</p>

            <p class="excerpt">The digital world has undergone an emotional transformation in the past few years. The once plain, typographic emoticons graphically expressing human emotion have now become an expansive collection of visually stimulating emoji. Will automating the expression of human emotion change us?</p>

<p>It’s been hard not to feel a deepening of the soul as the palette of online emotion signifiers has expanded from sparse typographic emoticons to colorful and animated emoji. (Nicolas Carr, “<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=3693">Automating the feels</a>”)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="blog/assets/img/2013/emoji-transformation.png" alt="Emoji Transformation"></p>

<p>Social networks (and digital products) are now focusing on providing tools to help users express how they feel. Structuring human emotion into a machine-readable format might possibly be the next holy grail of the digital world. </p>

<p>However, these seemingly innocuous tools have the power to change us by changing the way we express ourselves. If you have have an emotion that cannot be encapsulated in any available emoji, did you really feel it? At least by putting <em>some</em> type of graphically-expressible emotional symbol in a post you (and your friends) will know you felt <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>The problem is human emotion is so heterogeneous, nuanced, and penetrating that language itself often falls short of describing it. How many times have you heard, “There are no words to describe this”? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more we rely on finishing ideas with the same limited words (feeling happy) and images (smiley face) available to everyone on a platform, the more those pre-fabricated symbols structure and limit the ideas we express … these expression makes us one-dimensional, living caricatures of G-mail’s canned responses — a style of speech better suited to emotionless computers than flesh-and-blood humans. As Marshall McLuhan observed, just as we shape our tools, they shape us too. It’s a two-way street. - <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/08/move-over-social-graph-its-time-for-the-mood-graph-and-that-might-not-be-a-good-thing/">Evan Selinger</a></p>

        <p>Drew Crawford recently wrote a lengthy, in-depth article titled “<a href="http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/">Why mobile web apps are slow</a>”. A lot of it was over my head; nevertheless, I enjoyed his exhaustive, heavily-cited exposition on managed languages and their performance (especially on mobile) vs. compiled languages. </p>

<h2>Change the whole way you think about mobile software development</h2>

<p>Towards the latter half of the article, Crawford asserts, “What you are about to read should change the whole way you think about mobile software development.” That’s a pretty big assertion. Even though I couldn’t completely grasp everything he had written up to that point, I had to continue reading.</p>

<p>Crawford explains how, in 2012, Apple pulled garbage collection from OSX. If you come from writing Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, or really any language since 1990 this should seem odd because, after all, garbage collection has been proven…right? Well, what makes this even more strange is that when Apple announced Automatic Reference Counting (or ARC) as their approach to memory management and deprecated Garbage Collection (GC) in OSX, the audience broke out into applause! “Okay … this is really freaking weird,” Crawford states, “You mean to tell me that there’s a room full of developers applauding the return to the pre-garbage collection chaos?” Why?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is the reason I am writing this article. Here’s what Apple had to say about ARC vs. GC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the top of your wish list of things we could do for you is bringing garbage collection to iOS. And that is exactly what we are not going to do… Unfortunately garbage collection has a suboptimal impact on performance. Garbage can build up in your applications and increase the high water mark of your memory usage. And the collector tends to kick in at undeterministic times which can lead to very high CPU usage and stutters in the user experience. And that’s why GC has not been acceptable to us on our mobile platforms. In comparison, manual memory management with retain/release is harder to learn, and quite frankly it’s a bit of a pain in the ass. But it produces better and more predictable performance, and that’s why we have chosen it as the basis of our memory management strategy. <strong>Because out there in the real world, high performance and stutter-free user experiences are what matters to our users.</strong> ~Session 300, Developer Tools Kickoff, 2011, 00:47:49</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you catch that? Apple asserts that garbage collection kicks in at unexpected times leading to high CPU usage which will hamper the user experience. In comparison, ARC “produces better and more predictable performance” which will not hamper the user experience at unexpected times. Apple chose manual memory management not for themselves (after all, it’s a “pain in the ass”) but for their users.  They chose the hard way, the long-way round, because “out there in the real world, stutter-free user experiences are what matters to users.”</p>

<p>Apple chose to put users first rather than developers, marketers, pundits, and many others. Judging by their success, would you say it has paid off?</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="/jim-nielsen.com/blog/posts/sass-variable-interpolation-workarounds">Workarounds to Variable Interpolation in Sass</a></h1>
        
            <p class="excerpt">Variable interpolation is currently not supported in Sass. If you want to map key value pairs for something such as a brand to its color, you can create a lookup function to do the trick.</p>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Currently in Sass, interpolating list values in variable names is not supported (although maps are <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/132#issuecomment-17581804">supposedly slated for Sass 3.3</a>). However, there is a workaround solution until maps come. Allow me to elaborate:</p>

<h2>How I Thought It Could Work</h2>

<p>A recent design project required I use a large variety of brand colors. To make things easy I wanted each brand name and it&#39;s corresponding brand color to be available for use at any time, both in HTML and CSS. Thus, for each brand color, I needed to create a CSS class (for use in HTML) and a Sass variable (for use in CSS output).</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Variables for Sass usage
$nike: #ffaadd;
$facebook: #ff8811; 
$yahoo: #aaddcc;

// CSS Classes for HTML usage
.brand-nike { color: #ffaadd; }
.brand-facebook { color: #ff8811; }
.brand-yahoo { color: #aaddcc; }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Initially, I thought I could create a variable for each brand and use the <code>@each</code> directive to interpolate the values of a list containing all my brand names for the variables names I created. Something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Brand Variables
$nike: #ffaadd;
$facebook: #ff8811; 
$yahoo: #aaddcc;

// List of Brand Names
$brand-names: nike, facebook, yahoo;

// Output a class for each
@each $brand-names in $brand-name {
    .#{$brand-name}-color {
        color: $#{brand-name};
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, I soon discovered that variable interpolation is not currently supported in Sass. You can read more on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sass-lang/upr78cyrW1I">variable interpolation google group</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/132">Sass Github issues</a>.</p>

<h2>A Workaround to Variable Interpolation</h2>

<p>User jonjaques put forward two <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/132#issuecomment-4335097">interesting workarounds</a> for mapping values which I customized for my project. First I created two lists: <code>$brand-names</code> and <code>$brand-colors</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Brand names and colors
$brand-names: nike, facebook, yahoo;
$brand-colors: #ffaadd, #ff8811, #aaddcc;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The one caveat for my workaround is that the list indexes must correspond. For example, if &#39;facebook&#39; is the second name in the list <code>$brand-names</code>, Facebook’s color value must be second in the list  <code>$brand-colors</code>.</p>

<p>To output a CSS class for each brand, I used a loop. To have on-demand access to brand colors in my Sass files, I created a lookup function.</p>

<h3>CSS Classes: Loop Through Two Corresponding Lists</h3>

<p>To output a CSS class for each brand and it’s corresponding color, I used the <code>@for</code> directive to loop through the two lists:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Create a CSS class for each brand
@for $i from 1 through length($brand-names) {
    .color-#{nth($brand-names, $i)} {
        color: nth($brand-colors, $i);
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The CSS output of this loop would look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">.color-nike {
    color: #ffaadd;
}
.color-facebook {
    color: #ff8811;
}
.color-yahoo {
    color: #aaddcc;
}
</code></pre></div>
<h3>On-Demand Solution: Create a Lookup Function</h3>

<p>To have brand color values available on-demand while writing Sass code I created a lookup function. In my case, the function mapped a brand name in <code>$brand-names</code> to a brand color in <code>$brand-color</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Lookup function for a brand, returns a color
@function get-brand-color($search) {
    $index: index($brand-names, $search);
    @return nth($brand-colors, $index);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above, <code>$search</code> is the brand name I’m looking for in <code>$brand-names</code>. The function returns the brand’s corresponding color. A simpler way of writing this would be to nest the list function <code>index()</code> like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Lookup function for a brand, returns a color
@function get-brand-color($search) {
    @return nth($brand-colors, index($brand-names, $search));
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>As an example, if I needed <code>&lt;div class=&quot;facebook-box&quot;&gt;</code> to have the background color of Facebook, I could do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">div.facebook-box {
    background: get-brand-color(&quot;facebook&quot;);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>get-brand-color</code> function takes the value I passed to it (facebook) and searches the list <code>$brand-names</code> for that value, returning its index position in the list. Then, the function grabs the corresponding index in <code>$brand-colors</code>, which should be the brand name&#39;s color (if you’ve mapped your lists correctly). The CSS output would look like this: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">div.facebook-box {
    background: #ff8811;
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are some good work arounds to variable interpolation available. Hopefully these examples get you on the right track for your own projects until Sass 3.3 is stable for release. Happy coding! </p>

        <p>Somewhat recently on Quora, someone asked &quot;<a href="http://www.quora.com/Life/What-are-the-top-10-things-that-we-should-be-informed-about-in-life">What are the top 10 things that we should be informed about, in life?</a>&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Justin-Freeman">Justin Freeman</a>, self-described as someone who is &quot;great at stuff nobody pays for&quot;, gave an excellent response to this question. I know I&#39;m only 26, but I like to think I&#39;ve learned a few things in life. And those few things I have learned seem to align perfectly with these excerpts from Justin&#39;s response:</p>

<h2>Nobody Cares</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Realize that nobody cares, and if they do, you shouldn&#39;t care that they care. Got a new car? Nobody cares. You&#39;ll get some gawkers for a couple of weeks—they don&#39;t care … Three weeks in it&#39;ll be just another shiny blob among all the thousands of others crawling down the freeway and sitting in garages and driveways up and down your street … Got a new gewgaw? New wardrobe? Went to a swanky restaurant? Exotic vacation? Nobody cares. <strong>Don&#39;t base your happiness on people caring, because they won&#39;t. And if they do, they either want your stuff or hate you for it.</strong> (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A Select Few Will Actually Care</h2>

<p>You will encounter a few people in your life who will defy the odds and break the general rule that &quot;nobody cares&quot;. They won&#39;t care about your stuff, but they will care about you. As for the stuff you care about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… if they value you, they&#39;ll value that you value it, and they&#39;ll listen. When you talk about all of those things that nobody else cares about, they will look into your eyes and consume your words, and in that moment you will know that every part of them is there with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I married one of these rule breakers, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. But you don&#39;t have to marry them. You can befriend them, work with them, or spend time with them. No matter how much power you have, you cannot <strong>make</strong> other people sincerely care. So, as Freeman says, gather close the ones who do.</p>

<h2>Money is Expensive</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Money … it&#39;s difficult to get your hands on sometimes—and you never know when someone&#39;s going to pull the floorboards out from under you—so don&#39;t be stupid with it. Avoid debt on depreciating assets, and never incur debt in order to assuage your vanity. Debt has become normative, but don&#39;t blithely accept it as a rite of passage into adulthood—<strong>debt represents imbalance and, in some sense, often a resignation of control</strong>. Student loan debt isn&#39;t always unavoidable, but it isn&#39;t a given—my wife and I completed a combined ten years of college with zero debt between us. If you can&#39;t avoid it, though, make sure that your degree is an investment rather than a liability—I mourn a bit for all of the people going tens of thousands of dollars in debt in pursuit of vague liberal arts degrees with no idea of what they want out of life. If you&#39;re just dropping tuition dollars for lack of a better idea at the moment, just withdraw and go wander around Europe for a few weeks—I guarantee you&#39;ll spend less and learn more in the process. (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I spent two years wandering around in Mexico before college. I learned more about the meaning and purpose of life there than I ever did in four years of college.</p>
