        <p>When an idea strikes, what do you do with it? The commonly-held belief is that you sketch the idea on paper, as a sort of refinement process. Why? Because ideas, especially visual ones, are conceptually rough and difficult to articulate. Sketching an idea on paper can be a process of refinement. Through sketching, an idea becomes sufficiently polished to warrant actual implementation.</p>

<p>However, there is another purpose to sketching that is often overlooked. Sketching isn&#39;t always about slowly shaping and fine-tuning a single idea. In Smashing Magazine&#39;s recent publication <em><a href="http://www.the-mobile-book.com/">The Mobile Book</a></em>, Dennis Kardys writes a chapter called “Hands on Design for Mobile” in which he points out this disparate purpose to ideation and sketching:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We often think of sketching as a way to generate and communicate ideas, but it can also be a weapon to dismantle them. The goal of sketching ... isn’t to produce drawings that inform the final design ... The goal is to drive out those stubborn, thorny ideas and make room for new ones. Only then can we look anew and achieve a deeper understanding of what we’re designing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you work with ideas like a mason works with stone. You start with a large, unformed block of stone and slowly chip away at it until you arrive at the finished product. However, sometimes you work with ideas like a farmer doing a controlled burn. You burn everything down to make room for new growth. Only then do you see anew things hidden beforehand. </p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/filler-content-tools-tips-and-a-dynamic-example/">a link</a> to my most recent article. I talk about how to leverage filler content in your design process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of website design used to take place in Photoshop, manually copying/pasting text from the web was the best method for ‘filling in’ a design with dummy content. However, now that a lot of website design takes place in the browser, why not have the computer do all ‘filling in’ work for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a new era for designing in the browser.</p>

        <p>Have you ever felt exhausted by infinite scrolling?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infinite scrolling merely tempts you to continue reading, wasting time and decreasing productivity in the process ... Even more annoying is that scroll bars do not reflect the actual amount of data available. You’ll scroll down happily assuming you are close to the bottom, which by itself tempts you to scroll that little bit more, only to find that the results have just doubled by the time you get there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered this many times. It&#39;s exhausting. The worst part is that you keep telling yourself “just a little further” because you perpetually see the scroll bar two-thirds of the way down the page and don&#39;t want to feel as though you&#39;re missing out on any information.</p>

<p>Yogev Ahuvia wrote <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/03/infinite-scrolling-get-bottom/">a great article over at Smashing Magazine</a> that analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using infinite scrolling. It&#39;s worth a read. </p>
