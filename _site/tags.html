    <div class="content">
        <p>I was recently reading “The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin” and came across an interesting little story that made me think of Benjamin Franklin as a believer in open source.</p>

<p>Back in the 1700’s, Franklin invented an open stove that vastly improved the warming of rooms while simultaneously saving more fuel. He presented the model to friends and wrote a pamphlet about it which garnered him a lot of attention and positive publicity. His invention and writing had such a good effect that even the governor of Philadelphia used his stove and loved it. Here’s what happened next:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gov’r Thomas was so pleas’d with the construction of this stove ... that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declin’d it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we could all do to forget the monetary incentives behind innovative inventions and put human beings and their benefit back at the center of our daily purposes. As Paul Rand says, “It is only when man is not accepted as the centre of human concern that it becomes feasible to create a system of production which values profit out of proportion to responsible public service”.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>John Mayer, an incredibly influential and accomplished guitarist, speaks about the evolution of his personal skill set in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8G5-pug_w">this recording at Abbey Road</a>. These were a few points I found fascinating is his commentary on creativity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal development comes about through failure, often times in the failure to imitate someone else’s success.</li>
<li>Exponential development of any skill is easy at the outset, but that type of rapid improvement doesn’t last forever.</li>
<li>It takes a lot of time — years — to develop your own creative style.</li>
<li>Whatever you’re producing changes over the years. The work of year one is different than the work of year ten which is different than the work of year fifteen.</li>
<li>Learning the technical side of creativity is the easy part. You spend the rest of your life learning how to employ those technical skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s my transcript of the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well when you&#39;re first starting out with something like guitar, like an instrument, like anything really, you can just keep doubling your capacity by the week. You’re 100% better next month, then 100% better the next month compared to the beginning. So I was completely enamored with that and wasn&#39;t into singing or writing or doing anything I was just in a kind of hands-on bootcamp for playing guitar. <br><br> About 17 years old I wanted to start writing songs and I realized I didn’t know anyone who could sing them. So I just started right in trying to sing and it was … [shakes head in disgust]. It took a lot of years to develop a more boiled-down vocal sound. You develop a style when you fail to sound exactly like the person you’re trying to sound like. Even in the songs I try to cover sometimes I’ll be really afraid that it’s a facsimile of the original song and then I go back and listen to the original song and I realize how many of my own instincts have made their way into there. So a lot of it is accidental, you know? What’s really interesting in the growth of all this is that I have gotten to be a better singer within the arc of my records. The way I sang in my first record is completely different from the way I’ve been singing in the last couple. I think now I’ve kinda found my way. Singing is a sticky and kind of hard-to-manage thing sometimes.<br><br> I don’t get twice as good on the guitar these days, you know, I haven’t for a while. But what I’m picking up now are the kind of like zen things, just in terms of thinking, because I have the technical side down now. It’s just a matter of ‘how does that implant itself in my mind’. And that’s kind of the ultimate - that you spend the rest of your life figuring out.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Wired recently did <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/center_of_gravity/">an interview with Alfonso Cuarón</a>, the director of the film <em>Gravity</em>. Cuarón relates how making the film took four and a half years. When asked why it was so difficult, he responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We had to do the whole film as an animation first. We edited that animation, even with sound, just to make sure the timing worked with the sound effects and music. And once we were happy with it, we had to do the lighting in the animation as well. Then all that animation translated to actual camera moves and positions for the lighting and actors. <strong>We did a whole exploration of the screenplay, every single moment; we made judgments about everything.</strong> Once we began shooting, we were constrained by the limitations of that programming. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you catch that? Before it was filmed the entire movie was, in the terms of web designers, wireframed. </p>

<p>Now I am not familiar with the world of film production, but I can see “wireframing movies” becoming an extremely popular practice based solely on the explorative, iterative nature of wireframes. This would allow directors to explore timing, camera angles, plot development, and other valuable components that constitute great film making.</p>

<p>Similarly, as web designers, I think we would do well to imitate this same exploratory process in designing online experiences. Wireframing an entire website or experience can help explore every single moment of interaction and allow you (the designer) to make better, more informed decisions on molding the components of your website, like information architecture, URL design, animatable interactions, and so forth.</p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I’m not sure why, but people love to curse. In fact, curse words are losing their potency and becoming increasingly banal because of overuse.</p>

<p>For example, my Dad rarely cursed. When he did, it was never anything more than ‘damn’ or ‘hell’. However, when he used those words you knew he was mad. And if by some chance he said ‘shit’, well then you had better get as far away as possible because he was mad as a hornet (most likely from striking his thumb with a hammer). Now-a-days, it seems as though the use of profanity really gives no intimation into someone’s mood.</p>

<h2>Profanity in Human Language</h2>

<p>Profanity is the part of language that many consider impolite, offensive, or vulgar. Its use is to either <strong>a)</strong> show crude debasement of someone or something, or <strong>b)</strong> show strong or intense emotions. Excessive vulgarity is quite detrimental to character, it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gives a bad impression</li>
<li>Makes for unpleasant company</li>
<li>Is a tool for whiners and complainers</li>
<li>Is disrespectful</li>
<li>Reveals lack of self-control and character</li>
<li>Is immature, uneducated, and unsophisticated</li>
<li>Sets a bad example</li>
<li>Contributes to a decline in civility</li>
<li>Is offensive and abrasive</li>
<li>Can easily be interpreted as a gesture of hostility</li>
<li>Corrosive to human language</li>
<li>Is not effectively expressive; neglects better word choices and lacks imagination</li>
</ul>

<h2>An Example of Ostentatious Design</h2>

<p>This app is called <a href="http://www.authenticweather.com/">Authentic Weather</a> and it’s censored by Apple’s app store for vulgarity:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Authentic-Weather-for-iOS/10324571"><img src="http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/93/b3/da/93b3da38-9daf-fd31-fd1e-b8cdf10183f1/screen568x568.jpeg" alt="Authentic Weather screenshot from iTunes"></a></p>

<p>Why do we need that? Why do we need to say, “It&#39;s f---ing cloudy now”? The point of the app, according to <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Authentic-Weather-for-iOS/10324571">this gallery</a>, is to be authentic, honest, and get to the point. If you want to get to the point, leave out the superfluous words. Simply say “it’s cloudy”. You don&#39;t need the expletive “f---ing”. It’s unwarranted and crude. In addition, you don’t need the word “now” because of the present tense conjugation “it’s”.  If you want to “get to the point”, as the app’s proclamation states, “it’s raining” is more succinct.</p>

<p>Some might argue, “but the cursing adds personality”. The dictionary defines personality as “the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual’s distinct character”. So if you want to hang out with someone (or something, in this case an app) whose character is formed by an unrefined, debased lexicon full or superfluous crudities then by all means.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As designers (and human beings) let’s ennoble people. Eliciting emotion through vulgarity is a lot easier than doing it through nobility (or at least decency). And that applies to everything be it design, humor, education, or anything else. </p>

<p>You want to be good? Elicit human emotion (like the book 50 Shades of Grey). You want to be great? Ennoble the human spirit and intellect (like the timeless book Les Miserables).</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/posts/kindlingapp-home-page-redesign">Home Page Redesign of kindlingapp.com</a></h1>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I recently redesigned the <a href="http://kindlingapp.com">kindlingapp.com</a> home page. The old home page jumped right into talking about APIs and security features without ever describing what the software was actually for. In contrast, the new design strives to more clearly and succinctly articulate what Kindling is and what real-life problems it solves.</p>

<h2>Communicating Clearly</h2>

<p>There’s an article stating how <a href="http://qz.com/132070/the-simple-reason-products-fail-consumers-dont-understand-what-they-do/">the simple reason products fail is because consumers don’t understand what they do</a>. To create a new, successful product you have to be able to communicate to customers what it is your product does and how it can solve their problems.</p>

<p>Upon first impression that may sound easy, but it’s harder than you might think. Genuinely original and innovative products don’t fall into existing product categories. As a result, these innovations are often difficult to describe because there is no current framework for understanding them. Things that are difficult to describe will be even more difficult to understand, and that’s where the problem begins for businesses: when consumers don’t understand a product’s purpose they immediately lose interest.</p>

<p>One of the best places to communicate what your business is all about is your website. Communicating an entire product’s purpose on the homepage requires lots of focus and discipline. </p>

<p>The new disciplined design for <a href="http://kindlingapp.com">kindlingapp.com</a> focuses on narrating how Kindling is useful in discovering, sharing, and realizing ideas within an organization. My wife, after seeing the new page, said, &quot;oh, I actually know what the company you work for does now&quot;. </p>

<h2>The Design</h2>

<p>The design started with a collaborative Google doc for the page’s copy. Though not visual, creating and crafting the copy was one of the most difficult tasks of the design. After innumerable edits the copy provided enough substance to get started on devising visuals for the narrative. I started with various sketches to determine how and where the visuals could aid in communicating Kindling’s purpose.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/kindling-home-sketch.jpg" alt="Kindling home page sketches"></p>

<p>The artwork was then created in Photoshop. I dribbled a few previews of the work for historical sake:</p>

<p><a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1233555-Narrative-and-artwork-concepts"><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44352/screenshots/1233555/home-artwork.png" alt="Narrative and artwork concepts"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1237949-People-graphic"><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44352/screenshots/1237949/people.png" alt="People Artwork"></a></p>

<p>After drawing up the graphics and reviewing them with stakeholders, it was time to turn the design elements into markup and responsively test the designs across devices:</p>

<p><a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1242191-Testing-responsively-now"><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44352/screenshots/1242191/drib.jpg" alt="Testing responsively now"></a></p>

<h2>Final Product</h2>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/kindling-home-preview.jpg" alt="Kindling home page screenshot"></p>

<p>It seems rather simple but forming the narrative and accompanying graphics took a lot of work. It is difficult to take everything an entire company stands for and distill it into a page that’s clear and simple enough for an anyone to understand. </p>

<p>Iteration on the narrative will continue to take place, but this new home page was a great leap forward in explaining the problems Kindling’s software can solve.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/iphone-commercial.jpg" alt="iPhone internet TV ad screenshot"></p>

<p>Those are the words from a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldjHqHC6szA">2007 TV ad</a> showcasing the capabilities of Apple’s new iPhone which allowed you to browse the internet. Not the stripped-down version so many PDAs and other mobile devices were accessing at the time, but the real internet. The same internet you saw on your desktop computer. That was revolutionary.</p>

<p>Why? People want the web to be universal. They want the same internet they use everywhere else. They want to see and do the same things on their mobile device that they see and do on their desktop at home. So next time you think about stripping a feature from your responsive website or creating an entirely different “mobile-optimized” version of it remember this ad. </p>

<p>I‘d venture to say that most people would rather double tap and two-finger pinch their way around the “desktop” web than be short-changed on content or capabilities for a “mobile-optimized” web.</p>

            <p class="excerpt">The digital world has undergone an emotional transformation in the past few years. The once plain, typographic emoticons graphically expressing human emotion have now become an expansive collection of visually stimulating emoji. Will automating the expression of human emotion change us?</p>

<p>It’s been hard not to feel a deepening of the soul as the palette of online emotion signifiers has expanded from sparse typographic emoticons to colorful and animated emoji. (Nicolas Carr, “<a href="http://www.roughtype.com/?p=3693">Automating the feels</a>”)</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/emoji-transformation.png" alt="Emoji Transformation"></p>

<p>Social networks (and digital products) are now focusing on providing tools to help users express how they feel. Structuring human emotion into a machine-readable format might possibly be the next holy grail of the digital world. </p>

<p>However, these seemingly innocuous tools have the power to change us by changing the way we express ourselves. If you have have an emotion that cannot be encapsulated in any available emoji, did you really feel it? At least by putting <em>some</em> type of graphically-expressible emotional symbol in a post you (and your friends) will know you felt <em>something</em>.</p>

<p>The problem is human emotion is so heterogeneous, nuanced, and penetrating that language itself often falls short of describing it. How many times have you heard, “There are no words to describe this”? </p>

<blockquote>
<p>The more we rely on finishing ideas with the same limited words (feeling happy) and images (smiley face) available to everyone on a platform, the more those pre-fabricated symbols structure and limit the ideas we express … these expression makes us one-dimensional, living caricatures of G-mail’s canned responses — a style of speech better suited to emotionless computers than flesh-and-blood humans. As Marshall McLuhan observed, just as we shape our tools, they shape us too. It’s a two-way street. - <a href="http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/08/move-over-social-graph-its-time-for-the-mood-graph-and-that-might-not-be-a-good-thing/">Evan Selinger</a></p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Drew Crawford recently wrote a lengthy, in-depth article titled “<a href="http://sealedabstract.com/rants/why-mobile-web-apps-are-slow/">Why mobile web apps are slow</a>”. A lot of it was over my head; nevertheless, I enjoyed his exhaustive, heavily-cited exposition on managed languages and their performance (especially on mobile) vs. compiled languages. </p>

<h2>Change the whole way you think about mobile software development</h2>

<p>Towards the latter half of the article, Crawford asserts, “What you are about to read should change the whole way you think about mobile software development.” That’s a pretty big assertion. Even though I couldn’t completely grasp everything he had written up to that point, I had to continue reading.</p>

<p>Crawford explains how, in 2012, Apple pulled garbage collection from OSX. If you come from writing Ruby, Python, Javascript, Java, or really any language since 1990 this should seem odd because, after all, garbage collection has been proven…right? Well, what makes this even more strange is that when Apple announced Automatic Reference Counting (or ARC) as their approach to memory management and deprecated Garbage Collection (GC) in OSX, the audience broke out into applause! “Okay … this is really freaking weird,” Crawford states, “You mean to tell me that there’s a room full of developers applauding the return to the pre-garbage collection chaos?” Why?</p>

<p>The answer to that question is the reason I am writing this article. Here’s what Apple had to say about ARC vs. GC:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>At the top of your wish list of things we could do for you is bringing garbage collection to iOS. And that is exactly what we are not going to do… Unfortunately garbage collection has a suboptimal impact on performance. Garbage can build up in your applications and increase the high water mark of your memory usage. And the collector tends to kick in at undeterministic times which can lead to very high CPU usage and stutters in the user experience. And that’s why GC has not been acceptable to us on our mobile platforms. In comparison, manual memory management with retain/release is harder to learn, and quite frankly it’s a bit of a pain in the ass. But it produces better and more predictable performance, and that’s why we have chosen it as the basis of our memory management strategy. <strong>Because out there in the real world, high performance and stutter-free user experiences are what matters to our users.</strong> ~Session 300, Developer Tools Kickoff, 2011, 00:47:49</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you catch that? Apple asserts that garbage collection kicks in at unexpected times leading to high CPU usage which will hamper the user experience. In comparison, ARC “produces better and more predictable performance” which will not hamper the user experience at unexpected times. Apple chose manual memory management not for themselves (after all, it’s a “pain in the ass”) but for their users.  They chose the hard way, the long-way round, because “out there in the real world, stutter-free user experiences are what matters to users.”</p>

<p>Apple chose to put users first rather than developers, marketers, pundits, and many others. Judging by their success, would you say it has paid off?</p>

            <p class="excerpt">Variable interpolation is currently not supported in Sass. If you want to map key value pairs for something such as a brand to its color, you can create a lookup function to do the trick.</p>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Currently in Sass, interpolating list values in variable names is not supported (although maps are <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/132#issuecomment-17581804">supposedly slated for Sass 3.3</a>). However, there is a workaround solution until maps come. Allow me to elaborate:</p>

<h2>How I Thought It Could Work</h2>

<p>A recent design project required I use a large variety of brand colors. To make things easy I wanted each brand name and it&#39;s corresponding brand color to be available for use at any time, both in HTML and CSS. Thus, for each brand color, I needed to create a CSS class (for use in HTML) and a Sass variable (for use in CSS output).</p>

<p>Something like this:</p>

$nike: #ffaadd;
$facebook: #ff8811; 
$yahoo: #aaddcc;

// CSS Classes for HTML usage
.brand-nike { color: #ffaadd; }
.brand-facebook { color: #ff8811; }
.brand-yahoo { color: #aaddcc; }
</code></pre></div>
<p>Initially, I thought I could create a variable for each brand and use the <code>@each</code> directive to interpolate the values of a list containing all my brand names for the variables names I created. Something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Brand Variables
$nike: #ffaadd;
$facebook: #ff8811; 
$yahoo: #aaddcc;

// List of Brand Names
$brand-names: nike, facebook, yahoo;

// Output a class for each
@each $brand-names in $brand-name {
    .#{$brand-name}-color {
        color: $#{brand-name};
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>However, I soon discovered that variable interpolation is not currently supported in Sass. You can read more on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!topic/sass-lang/upr78cyrW1I">variable interpolation google group</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/132">Sass Github issues</a>.</p>

<h2>A Workaround to Variable Interpolation</h2>

<p>User jonjaques put forward two <a href="https://github.com/nex3/sass/issues/132#issuecomment-4335097">interesting workarounds</a> for mapping values which I customized for my project. First I created two lists: <code>$brand-names</code> and <code>$brand-colors</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Brand names and colors
$brand-names: nike, facebook, yahoo;
$brand-colors: #ffaadd, #ff8811, #aaddcc;
</code></pre></div>
<p>The one caveat for my workaround is that the list indexes must correspond. For example, if &#39;facebook&#39; is the second name in the list <code>$brand-names</code>, Facebook’s color value must be second in the list  <code>$brand-colors</code>.</p>

<p>To output a CSS class for each brand, I used a loop. To have on-demand access to brand colors in my Sass files, I created a lookup function.</p>

<h3>CSS Classes: Loop Through Two Corresponding Lists</h3>

<p>To output a CSS class for each brand and it’s corresponding color, I used the <code>@for</code> directive to loop through the two lists:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Create a CSS class for each brand
@for $i from 1 through length($brand-names) {
    .color-#{nth($brand-names, $i)} {
        color: nth($brand-colors, $i);
    }
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The CSS output of this loop would look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">.color-nike {
    color: #ffaadd;
}
.color-facebook {
    color: #ff8811;
}
.color-yahoo {
    color: #aaddcc;
}
</code></pre></div>
<h3>On-Demand Solution: Create a Lookup Function</h3>

<p>To have brand color values available on-demand while writing Sass code I created a lookup function. In my case, the function mapped a brand name in <code>$brand-names</code> to a brand color in <code>$brand-color</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Lookup function for a brand, returns a color
@function get-brand-color($search) {
    $index: index($brand-names, $search);
    @return nth($brand-colors, $index);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example above, <code>$search</code> is the brand name I’m looking for in <code>$brand-names</code>. The function returns the brand’s corresponding color. A simpler way of writing this would be to nest the list function <code>index()</code> like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">// Lookup function for a brand, returns a color
@function get-brand-color($search) {
    @return nth($brand-colors, index($brand-names, $search));
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>As an example, if I needed <code>&lt;div class=&quot;facebook-box&quot;&gt;</code> to have the background color of Facebook, I could do:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">div.facebook-box {
    background: get-brand-color(&quot;facebook&quot;);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>get-brand-color</code> function takes the value I passed to it (facebook) and searches the list <code>$brand-names</code> for that value, returning its index position in the list. Then, the function grabs the corresponding index in <code>$brand-colors</code>, which should be the brand name&#39;s color (if you’ve mapped your lists correctly). The CSS output would look like this: </p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">div.facebook-box {
    background: #ff8811;
}
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>There are some good work arounds to variable interpolation available. Hopefully these examples get you on the right track for your own projects until Sass 3.3 is stable for release. Happy coding! </p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Somewhat recently on Quora, someone asked &quot;<a href="http://www.quora.com/Life/What-are-the-top-10-things-that-we-should-be-informed-about-in-life">What are the top 10 things that we should be informed about, in life?</a>&quot;</p>

<p><a href="http://www.quora.com/Justin-Freeman">Justin Freeman</a>, self-described as someone who is &quot;great at stuff nobody pays for&quot;, gave an excellent response to this question. I know I&#39;m only 26, but I like to think I&#39;ve learned a few things in life. And those few things I have learned seem to align perfectly with these excerpts from Justin&#39;s response:</p>

<h2>Nobody Cares</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Realize that nobody cares, and if they do, you shouldn&#39;t care that they care. Got a new car? Nobody cares. You&#39;ll get some gawkers for a couple of weeks—they don&#39;t care … Three weeks in it&#39;ll be just another shiny blob among all the thousands of others crawling down the freeway and sitting in garages and driveways up and down your street … Got a new gewgaw? New wardrobe? Went to a swanky restaurant? Exotic vacation? Nobody cares. <strong>Don&#39;t base your happiness on people caring, because they won&#39;t. And if they do, they either want your stuff or hate you for it.</strong> (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A Select Few Will Actually Care</h2>

<p>You will encounter a few people in your life who will defy the odds and break the general rule that &quot;nobody cares&quot;. They won&#39;t care about your stuff, but they will care about you. As for the stuff you care about?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>… if they value you, they&#39;ll value that you value it, and they&#39;ll listen. When you talk about all of those things that nobody else cares about, they will look into your eyes and consume your words, and in that moment you will know that every part of them is there with you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I married one of these rule breakers, and it was the best thing that ever happened to me. But you don&#39;t have to marry them. You can befriend them, work with them, or spend time with them. No matter how much power you have, you cannot <strong>make</strong> other people sincerely care. So, as Freeman says, gather close the ones who do.</p>

<h2>Money is Expensive</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Money … it&#39;s difficult to get your hands on sometimes—and you never know when someone&#39;s going to pull the floorboards out from under you—so don&#39;t be stupid with it. Avoid debt on depreciating assets, and never incur debt in order to assuage your vanity. Debt has become normative, but don&#39;t blithely accept it as a rite of passage into adulthood—<strong>debt represents imbalance and, in some sense, often a resignation of control</strong>. Student loan debt isn&#39;t always unavoidable, but it isn&#39;t a given—my wife and I completed a combined ten years of college with zero debt between us. If you can&#39;t avoid it, though, make sure that your degree is an investment rather than a liability—I mourn a bit for all of the people going tens of thousands of dollars in debt in pursuit of vague liberal arts degrees with no idea of what they want out of life. If you&#39;re just dropping tuition dollars for lack of a better idea at the moment, just withdraw and go wander around Europe for a few weeks—I guarantee you&#39;ll spend less and learn more in the process. (<em>emphasis added</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Personally, I spent two years wandering around in Mexico before college. I learned more about the meaning and purpose of life there than I ever did in four years of college.</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="/blog/posts/preserving-CSS-comments-during-compression">Preserving CSS Comments For Wordpress During Sass Compression</a></h1>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Compressing your CSS for production websites is a best-practice, especially if you&#39;re using a CSS preprocessor like Compass. If you don&#39;t compress your CSS, all your comments (along with stuff from Compass) will show up in your final CSS file. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example CSS rule before compression:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">/* line 22, ../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/compass-0.12.2/frameworks/compass/stylesheets/compass/reset/_utilities.scss */
// Here&#39;s a comment I have on styling my CSS
a:hover {
        border: 0; // remove border from CSS
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now here&#39;s that same rule compressed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">a:hover{border:0}
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should already be commenting your code generously. Thus, your CSS file size will increase rather quickly. Here&#39;s a comparison example of CSS file sizes for a project I&#39;m currently working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prior to compression
    - File size: 122.413kb 
    - Lines of code: 4,601</li>
<li>After compression:
    - File size: 81kb
    - Lines of code: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>To compress using Compass, simply run <code>compass compile -s compressed</code> to strip out all comments and other unnecessary content.</p>

<h2>How Do You Preserve Selective Comments?</h2>

<p>What if you want to preserve specific comments in your CSS? Suppose you want to include licensing information at the beginning of the file, or copyright information, or other required comments, how do you do it?</p>

<h3>Wordpress Example</h3>

<p>When creating a Wordpress theme, you <strong>must</strong> include CSS comments in <code>style.css</code> identifying your theme. It&#39;s usually something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">/*
Theme Name: Twenty Ten
Theme URI: http://wordpress.org/
Description: The 2010 default theme for WordPress.
Author: wordpressdotorg
Author URI: http://wordpress.org/
Version: 1.0
*/
</code></pre></div>
<p>Why? Wordpress uses that information in to identify themes. From the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Stylesheet">codex</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The stylesheet must provide details about the Theme in the form of comments. <strong>No two Themes are allowed to have the same details</strong> listed in their comment headers, as this will lead to problems in the Theme selection dialog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you&#39;re creating a Wordpress theme, it&#39;s imperative your theme-identifying CSS comments <strong>do not</strong> get stripped out during compression. </p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>To ensure specific CSS comments are included in a compressed file, make the first letter of a comment <code>!</code>. According to the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#comments">SASS documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the first letter of a comment is !, the comment will be interpolated and always rendered into css output even in compressed output modes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, in the example above, your Wordpress comments would go something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">/*!
Theme Name: Twenty Ten
Theme URI: http://wordpress.org/
Description: The 2010 default theme for WordPress.
Author: wordpressdotorg
Author URI: http://wordpress.org/
Version: 1.0
*/
</code></pre></div>
<p>Compass will now preserve that comment block when compressing your CSS. </p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Fact: the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060891548"><em>On Writing Well</em></a> by William Zinsser is simply stellar. His advice on writing is insightful and succinct. In addition, his thoughts on writing spill into other areas of life.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s two thoughts I found relevant to design:</p>

<h2>Designing is Not a Contest</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Every writer is starting from a different point and is bound for a different destination. Yet many writers are paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with everybody else who is trying to write and presumably doing better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This feeling of competition is often fostered in designers who see the work of associates being displayed in galleries while their own work gets no recognition. </p>

<p>Forget everyone else and go at your own pace. Nobody else is solving the exact design problem you are. Your problem is unique; hence your solution should be too. Your only contest is with yourself.</p>

<h2>Just Get Rid of It</h2>

<p>Have you ever tried adding a design element only to find it extremely frustrating to do so? You put the element through all kinds of exertions: you move it to various locations, you resize and reform its structure, you change its colors, you add supporting elements in hopes of clarify its purpose, only to find the overall design worse than where you started?</p>

<p>Zinsser says writers often encounter a similar impasse in constructing sentences. The solution? Get rid of the problem element. Unfortunately, this is usually our solution of last resort:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>look at the troublesome element and ask, &quot;do I need it at all?&quot; Probably you don&#39;t. It was trying to do an unnecessary job all along - thats why it was giving you so much grief. Remove it and watch the afflicted sentence spring to life and breathe normally. It&#39;s the quickest cure and often the best. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, the best solution is to get rid of the design element you&#39;re trying so hard to include.</p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Do you use <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogr.am</a>? Do you want to programmatically retrieve your most recent posts from the service using PHP? It&#39;s not as simple as an API call, but it can be done.</p>

<h2>Before We Begin: The Javascript Method</h2>

<p>In case you&#39;re interested, <a href="http://sicanstudios.com/post/recent-posts-scriptogram/">Alex at sicanstudios</a> has a great tutorial on how to retrieve and display your most recent Scriptogr.am posts using javascript.</p>

<h2>The PHP Method</h2>

<p>Scriptogr.am does not have a publicly accessible API. It does, however, provide an XML feed for each user. You can access your feed URL using this format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">http://scriptogr.am/USERNAME/feed/
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you use PHP&#39;s <code>file_get_contents()</code> and pass it your Scriptogr.am feed URL, you&#39;ll be returned your most recent posts and accompanying metadata in XML form. </p>

<h3>Converting XML to JSON in PHP</h3>

<p>Now that we have the data we want, we&#39;ve got to put it in the format we want (JSON). We can do that using the technique described in <a href="http://lostechies.com/seanbiefeld/2011/10/21/simple-xml-to-json-with-php/">this article from lostechies</a>.</p>

<h2>Cut to the Chase: The Code</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the final PHP snippet that does everything we&#39;ve described above. Just change the <code>$username</code> value to your own Scriptogr.am username and you&#39;re good to go!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">function get_scriptogram_JSON() {
    $username = &#39;jimniels&#39;;
    $url = &#39;http://scriptogr.am/&#39;. $username .&#39;/feed/&#39;;
    $fileContents = file_get_contents($url);
    $fileContents = str_replace(array(&quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\r&quot;, &quot;\t&quot;), &#39;&#39;, $fileContents);
    $fileContents = trim(str_replace(&#39;&quot;&#39;, &quot;&#39;&quot;, $fileContents));
    $simpleXml = simplexml_load_string($fileContents);
    $json = json_encode($simpleXml);
    return $json;
}
</code></pre></div>
    </div>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Neil Postman, in his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Technopoly-The-Surrender-Culture-Technology/dp/0679745408">Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology</a></em>, tells the story of how advertisers in the late 1800&#39;s began to realize marketing products isn&#39;t about extolling the benefits of the products themselves. Rather, effective advertising is, as Postman remarks, about using the persuasive power of language and photographs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Advertising is most effective when it is irrational. By irrational, I do not, of course, mean crazy. I mean that products [can] best be sold by exploiting the magical and even poetical powers of language and pictures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Postman uses the word &quot;irrational&quot; to reveal how advertisers previously employed logic and reason to sell products. However, they soon realized that compelling language and photographs were more powerful in consumers&#39; minds than logic and reason; hence the irrationality of advertising:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the turn of the century, advertisers no longer assumed that reason was the best instrument for the communication of commercial products and ideas. Advertising became one part depth psychology, one part aesthetic theory. In the process, a fundamental principle of capitalist ideology was rejected: namely, that the producer and consumer were engaged in a rational enterprise in which consumers made choices on the basis of a careful consideration of the quality of a product and their own self-interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rejection of rationality in consumer enterprise led to the type of advertising we have today, where commercials and ads aren&#39;t about the products being sold but rather the character of the consumers viewing the ad:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, the television commercial, for example, is rarely about the character of the products. It is about the character of the consumers of products. Images of movie stars and famous athletes, of serene lakes and macho fishing trips, of elegant dinners and romantic interludes, of happy families packing their station wagons for a picnic in the country — these tell nothing about the products being sold. But they tell everything about the fears, fancies, and dreams of those who might buy them. <strong>What the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer.</strong> And so the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research, <strong>which means orienting business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable.</strong> The business of business becomes pseudo-therapy; the consumer, a patient reassured by psychodramas. (emphasis added)</p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Take a look at this:</p>

<p><code>*</code></p>

<p>In CSS terms, that&#39;s the universal selector. Are warning sirens relating to performance sounding in your head? Are you feeling emotions of avoidance, like you do when you see <code>!important</code>? It&#39;s possible you do. The universal selector carries a negative stigma of poor performance. But should it? <a href="http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/">Paul Irish answers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently you’ve heard its slow. Firstly, it’s not. It is as fast as <code>h1</code> as a selector. It can be slow when you specifically use it like <code>.foo &gt;</code> , so don’t do that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be slow, but mostly it&#39;s not. Still, that may seem like reason enough in your mind to avoid using (or misusing) it. Stop thinking that way. Turn those &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger,_Will_Robinson">Danger, Will Robison!</a>&quot; sirens off. Don&#39;t be afraid to use it. Why? Paul Irish continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to care about the performance of <code>*</code> unless you concatenate all your javascript, have it at the bottom, minify your css and js, gzip all your assets, and losslessly compress all your images.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember that general rules of thumb, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>don&#39;t use the <code>*</code> selector, it&#39;s slow</li>
<li>don&#39;t use the <code>!important</code> rule</li>
</ul>

<p>are rules discovered and shared by developers working on immensely large scale applications and websites, like Google.com. Some rules just don&#39;t apply to your ten page Wordpress site. </p>

<p>The <code>*</code> and <code>!important</code> rules were invented for a reason. If you find yourself needing them, use them. That&#39;s what they were made for. If page performance takes a hit, look into larger-scale optimization techniques first, such as image optimization and concatenation. After that, you can get down to the nit-picky. In general, <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/css-selector-performance-has-changed-for-the-better/">optimization of selectors should be the job of the rendering engine</a>, not the designer.</p>

        <p>I recently redesigned my wordpress theme for <a href="http://iosicongallery.com">iOS Icon Gallery</a> and <a href="http://macicongallery.com">Mac Icon Gallery</a>. </p>

<p>The old themes provided the ability to comment through the interface. Due to a lack of real comments and a surplus in spam comments, I decided to entirely remove the ability to comment from the interface. </p>

<h2>Removing the Ability to Comment From the Interface Is Not Enough to Keep Out Spam</h2>

<p>Once my theme went live, I was still getting spam comments in the Wordpress backend. I asked myself, &quot;how are comments still appearing in the Wordpress backend when I don&#39;t have a single comment form on my website?&quot; After some Googling, I discovered this was due to spambots posting data directly using <code>wp-comments-post.php</code>. </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/sneaky.gif" alt="Sneaky Gif"></p>

<h2>Further Stopping Spambots</h2>

<p>To prevent spambots from posting to Wordpress via a URL, you can block access to <code>wp-comments-post.php</code> via the <code>.htaccess</code> file. Simply include these rules in your <code>.htaccess</code> file (thanks to <a href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/snippets/blockreduce-wordpress-spam-comments-via-htaccess">catswhocode</a>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .wp-comments-post.php*
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !.*yourdomainname.* [OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$
    RewriteRule (.*) ^http://%{REMOTE_ADDR}/$ [R=301,L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to change the <code>yourdomainname</code> part!</p>

<h2>That Doesn&#39;t Help You?</h2>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t seem like the best fix for you, try looking at this article from WP Tuts+ detailing <a href="http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/security/6-easy-and-efficient-ways-to-combat-spam-comments/">easy and efficient ways to combat spam comments</a>.</p>

<strong>Glass</strong>: Which American Express would you like to use?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: My gold card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Error. Sorry, you don&#39;t have a &quot;gold&quot; American Express card. Valid types are cards ending in: 4512 and 7483<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I don&#39;t know, use the card ending in 4512<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Processing … transaction cancelled. Trying again … it appears you don&#39;t have any money on this card. Trying American Express card ending in 7483 … processing<br>

<strong>Glass</strong>: Transaction stopped. What would you like to do now?<br>

<strong>Glass</strong>: You don&#39;t have any valid credit cards, but you can add a new one. What&#39;s the number?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I don&#39;t&#39; want to say my credit card number out loud.<br>

    <!-- Article Content

    <div class="content">
        <p>When an idea strikes, what do you do with it? The commonly-held belief is that you sketch the idea on paper, as a sort of refinement process. Why? Because ideas, especially visual ones, are conceptually rough and difficult to articulate. Sketching an idea on paper can be a process of refinement. Through sketching, an idea becomes sufficiently polished to warrant actual implementation.</p>

<p>However, there is another purpose to sketching that is often overlooked. Sketching isn&#39;t always about slowly shaping and fine-tuning a single idea. In Smashing Magazine&#39;s recent publication <em><a href="http://www.the-mobile-book.com/">The Mobile Book</a></em>, Dennis Kardys writes a chapter called “Hands on Design for Mobile” in which he points out this disparate purpose to ideation and sketching:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We often think of sketching as a way to generate and communicate ideas, but it can also be a weapon to dismantle them. The goal of sketching ... isn’t to produce drawings that inform the final design ... The goal is to drive out those stubborn, thorny ideas and make room for new ones. Only then can we look anew and achieve a deeper understanding of what we’re designing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you work with ideas like a mason works with stone. You start with a large, unformed block of stone and slowly chip away at it until you arrive at the finished product. However, sometimes you work with ideas like a farmer doing a controlled burn. You burn everything down to make room for new growth. Only then do you see anew things hidden beforehand. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of website design used to take place in Photoshop, manually copying/pasting text from the web was the best method for ‘filling in’ a design with dummy content. However, now that a lot of website design takes place in the browser, why not have the computer do all ‘filling in’ work for you?</p>

        <p>Have you ever felt exhausted by infinite scrolling?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infinite scrolling merely tempts you to continue reading, wasting time and decreasing productivity in the process ... Even more annoying is that scroll bars do not reflect the actual amount of data available. You’ll scroll down happily assuming you are close to the bottom, which by itself tempts you to scroll that little bit more, only to find that the results have just doubled by the time you get there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered this many times. It&#39;s exhausting. The worst part is that you keep telling yourself “just a little further” because you perpetually see the scroll bar two-thirds of the way down the page and don&#39;t want to feel as though you&#39;re missing out on any information.</p>

<p>Yogev Ahuvia wrote <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/03/infinite-scrolling-get-bottom/">a great article over at Smashing Magazine</a> that analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using infinite scrolling. It&#39;s worth a read. </p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Establishing a grid is a great way to organize and structure design elements. In addition, by breaking the organization and structure of the grid you can emphasize visual relationships between design elements.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks to Grids</h2>

<p>Recently I came across a subtle and often overlooked side-effect of grid-based design: unintended visual relationships. An example of this can be found in the Wordpress theme <a href="http://wpshower.com/themes/portfolium/">Portfolium</a> </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium.jpg" alt="Portfolium Screenshot"></p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a well executed grid-based design: organized and structured; however, the alignment of the navigation to the thumbnail grid suggests visual relationships that are nonexistent. </p>

<p>For example, take a look at the words at the top of the page: they align to the thumbnail grid. This suggests a columnar relationship between each navigation item and the thumbnails  below them. However, no such relationship actually exists.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-grid-alignment.jpg" alt="Portfolium Grid Alignment"></p>

<h2>Rows, Columns, or Neither?</h2>

<p>This type of unintended visual alignment is confusing. The words in the navigation align with the columns below them, suggesting some type of organization or categorization. Even the light grey lines below navigation item are visually separated which helps reinforce the idea of a column layout. Even so, there is no relationship between the navigation items and the thumbnails below them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you wanted to suggest a relationship between the navigation items and the thumbnails below them, the alignment of Portfolium would be ideal. For example, if you wanted to separate and categorize the thumbnails by column, this type of alignment would work very well:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-categories.jpg" alt="Portfolium Categories"></p>

<h2>A Better Alignment</h2>

<p>In the example of Portfolium, not aligning the navigation to the thumbnail grid would break the grid and provide a visual separation between the sections of image thumbnails and navigation. In addition, making the light grey line at the top a solid, unbroken line helps visually separate the header from the content.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-new.jpg" alt="Altered Portfolium Screenshot"></p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the creators of Portfolium had a purpose in mind when designing the theme the way they did. However, I don&#39;t see it. Take care to always be aware of how your grid elements are being aligned. In grid-based design, it&#39;s easy to unintentionally suggest visual relationship that don&#39;t exist.</p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I have a confession: for some time now I&#39;ve been cynical of art. More specifically modern art. For example, here is a piece of art I encountered at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City: </p>

<p><img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/A-wPHGACcAA7xOB.jpg" alt="Modern Art at the MoMA"></p>

<p>I can&#39;t help but ask myself: how is this art? Even more puzzling: how does it have a place in the world-renowned MoMA? At first-glance, this piece seems on par with something my four-year-old nephew could create. Then, as a web designer, I am reminded most people think websites are something their nephews could create too. </p>

<p>What&#39;s my point? I realize I don&#39;t understand or appreciate art because I am ignorant of it. People don&#39;t understand or appreciate web design because they are ignorant of it. As a general rule of thumb, the more you immerse yourself in something and learn its intricacies and rationales the more you come to appreciate and respect it. That goes for modern art or web design. Get to know the things you criticize. Generally, <strong>the more you know the less you will criticize</strong>.</p>

<h2>So Is It Art or Not?</h2>

<p>The question still remains, what is art? Is that scribbled piece of canvas art? Here&#39;s a tip from Milton Glaser, a celebrated graphic designer, on determining what is and is not art:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>you cannot tell art by virtue of medium, or function, or anything else except by the fact of its raising your consciousness to a degree that you are attentive. And so if something produces the state of attentiveness, whether it’s a drawing, or a guy making a cheese sandwich, we can call it art, at least by my description</p>
</blockquote>

<p>According to Glaser, if something &quot;produces a state of attentiveness&quot;, whether it&#39;s Van Gogh&#39;s <em>Starry Night</em> or this seemingly scribbled mess, you can call it art.</p>

<p>As you may have noticed, that scribbled mess at the MoMA brought me an incredible amount of introspection and reflection. It raised my consciousness to a degree that I was attentive. I suppose that is why it has a place at the Museum of Modern &quot;Art&quot;.</p>

    <div class="content">
        <p>I recently participated in the <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/hackathon/2012/">Arc90 Hackathon</a>. I originally volunteered for a different project as part of a team, but due to scheduling conflicts my team disbanded. I was left with the option to work on a solo project, which resulted in <a href="http://teamcolors.arc90.com/">Team Colors</a>: a single-page website that serves as a reference for HEX values for professional sport teams:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/team-colors.png" alt="Screenshot of Team Colors, an Arc90 Hackathon Project"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the Hackathon took place while I was absent from the office (travelling to Utah for the Christmas break). So a lot of my work was done on a plane and working from home. I started Team Colors by sketching out some ideas for the page hierarchy and navigation:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/team-colors-sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of Team Colors"></p>

<p>After thinking through and sketching out how to present each team and its corresponding brand colors in a responsive manner, I turned to writing some pseudocode that would power the interaction of the site:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/team-colors-code.jpg" alt="Pseudocode for Team Colors"></p>

<p>Once I got everything down on paper, the fun part of building began. The hardest part was  finding the actual HEX values for each team. There were some obscure, outdated forum posts scattered across the web. In the end Wikiepedia was my best reference, although it did not provide the brand colors in the user interface. I found them in the underlying HTML/CSS using Chrome developer tools.</p>

<h2>Technical Overview</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s a quick overview of the technology used:</p>

<ul>
<li>The page is responsive, built using HTML5, CSS, and the CSS preprocessor Compass</li>
<li>All the data (team names, hex values) is stored in a single JSON file. This makes updating the page quite simple. You just add a new league with teams, or a new team in the appropriate league with its corresponding HEX values. Then add the team&#39;s logo into the images directory and you&#39;re done!</li>
<li>Most team logos are SVGs, making them crisp on HiDPI devices. If a team logo isn&#39;t avaiable in SVG, a PNG fallback is used. </li>
<li>Progressive enhancement is used thoroughly:

<ul>
<li>Images are served by javascript after page load to reduce HTTP requests on the initial page load</li>
<li>All league/team data is loaded in a single page. Javasript is used to create a the drop-down control for sifting through teams by league and showing/hiding content.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

        <p>Seemingly high-quality freebies, who doesn&#39;t love them? They save lots of time. However, be careful to double check and properly adjust any small details that may be misaligned. As they say, design is in the details, and sometimes you can&#39;t always rely on someone else having invested in those details.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a vector freebie I got online today. I imported the shape into Photoshop and noticed a 1px offset in symmetry:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/freebie-offset.png" alt="Freebie 1px Offset"></p>

<p>I know you might be thinking, &quot;1px offset? Nobody will even notice that.&quot; And you know what? You&#39;re right. One little 1px offset in an image that&#39;s 16x16 pixels probably won&#39;t be noticed by many people. However, the accumulation of many 1px offsets in your digital creations <strong>will</strong> be noticed! It&#39;s worth practicing some self discipline because it will help avoid sloppy work.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/freebie-offset-select.png" alt="Freebie 1px Offset Shape Selection"></p>

<p>Ahhh, isn&#39;t this much better?</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/freebie-offset-fix.png" alt="Freebie 1px Offset Correction"></p>

<p>Don&#39;t assume the freebie is pixel-perfect, especially when transferring it between software applications. Keeping up your guard and not making assumptions will prevent slipshod work.</p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>If you&#39;ve ever used InDesign you&#39;ve no doubt used the &quot;Links&quot; panel. It allows you to link and embedd files in your document layout. InDesign keeps track of all the files you&#39;ve embedded and where they live on your hard drive. This gives you the power to relink files, updated modified files, edit the original files, and so forth. For example, say you embedd a logo in InDesign but then you want to modify it. You can go to the Links panel and click &quot;edit original&quot;. Illustrator (or whatever logo editing software you&#39;ve used) will open the file. You make your changes, save it, and go back to InDesign and the logo&#39;s changes will automatically update in your layout.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/links-panel-indesign.png" alt="Links Panel in InDesign"></p>

<p>I found myself wanting this feature in Photoshop. It would be extremely useful for building websites because you could modularize your PSDs. For example, I could create one PSD called <code>header.psd</code> and another called <code>footer.psd</code>. When I want to create a PSD for a new page mockup, I can easily &quot;embedd&quot; the header and footer PSDs into my new document. This allows me to easily spin-off new page mockups based on single PSD files. </p>

<p>So, for example, if I want to change a design element in the header of my website, I only have to change it in one file and it would be replicated in all the PSDs where I&#39;ve embedded <code>header.psd</code>. This is essentially the same thing as creating a file called <code>header.php</code> that has all my main navigation and is called into every page template.</p>

<p>Although InDesign supports this feature, Photoshop does not. However, a Google search led me to these two extensions which have become quite useful.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.ps-scripts.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=3045&amp;sid=90f57aa35b85d5d38fe52ea551ac4a4c">Smart Object Links Panel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.canlinkit.com/">CanLinkIt</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the development status of these are anymore, but they worked for me. Try them out! I think they will save you a lot of time. </p>

<p>Now with PSDs you can edit once and change everywhere!</p>

        <p>Can you really change the world over night?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In both the web and in our greater community, I see people despair that change doesn’t happen more quickly. That we can’t make the world better overnight. But if this year has taught me anything, it is that we can’t ignore the hard work that needs to be done. And that we all must take up the charge to make the world better than it we found it — both on the web and in our society. - <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/what-we-learned-in-2012">Jason Grigsby</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is so great about the web is that , with a single great idea, you <strong>can</strong> often build it overnight. Or at least in a few days. No bureaucracy. No paperwork. No meetings. No board approval.The <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/hackathon/2012/">Arc90 Hackathon</a> was a good example of this to me.  Get a good idea, start a conversation, excite others, build it, release it to the community, and if its great, you&#39;ll begin sowing the seeds of change. </p>

<p>From there you just iterate.  </p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I needed a star symbol in my design. That&#39;s how this all started. I wanted to use something other than an image to display the star on screen for various reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I wanted the star to be different colors in different contexts and I didn&#39;t want to create an image of the star for each variance. </li>
<li>I wanted the star to be crisp and clear, which meant I&#39;d have to create multiple sizes of the image for retina screen support.</li>
</ol>

<p>So rather than create a handful of stars as images (in different colors and sizes) I decided to try using the black star symbol in Unicode (U+2605, &amp;#9733).</p>

<h2>Unicode and Font Stack Correlations</h2>

<p>I began by simply inserting the character reference in my markup with the default CSS font-size of 1em and font stack of Helvetica. However, I stumbled on an inconsistency in modern browsers: the unicode star was rendering at different sizes in browsers that implement different rendering engines.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/black-star-unicode-arial-helvetica.png" alt="Black Star Unicode Using Helvetica and Arial Unicode MS"></p>

<p>Notice the size difference? It appears the black star unicode symbol is not supported by my default stack of Helvetica. In order to display the character, each browser is resorting to a font of it&#39;s own choosing that <em>does</em> support it. In this case, each browsers is choosing a different font; hence the size discrepancy. </p>

<p>By resorting to a font stack that supports the black star glyph (in this case Arial Unicode MS), I achieved consistent sizing across browsers. You can see the differences and similarities in this blown up photo:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/black-star-unicode-arial-helvetica-zoomed.png" alt="Zoomed in Photo of Black Star Unicode Glyph"></p>

<h2>But Wait, There&#39;s Always IE</h2>

<p>Of course, if you&#39;re trying to support IE, throw everything I just said out the window. The black star wasn&#39;t displaying in IE 7 &amp; 8 on Windows XP. This is because Windows XP, by default, didn&#39;t have a font that supports the black star glyph using standard Unicode. However, if the user had additional fonts installed, like the ones that come with MS Office, I&#39;m guessing this technique would probably work. I&#39;ll leave that up to someone else to test.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re going to use Unicode symbols, make sure you&#39;re using a font that supports them. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll find some strange inconsistencies across browsers. Here is Wikipedia&#39;s take:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Miscellaneous Symbols Unicode block (2600–26FF) contains various glyphs representing things from a variety of categories …  these [characters] may not display properly if your computer does not implement Unicode and have the proper fonts installed. Also, some browsers may not display certain symbols properly at all even if your computer has the required implemented Unicode and fonts. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started realizing consistent Unicode support across browsers and platforms was a rabbit&#39;s hole I didn&#39;t want to go down any further. So I switched my implementation technique to <a href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/">icon fonts</a>, which was much more bullet-proof.</p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Jon Tan, in a <a href="http://24ways.org/2012/science/">recent article at 24 Ways</a>, talks about the science behind the positive effects of good typography. In his article, he references a study by Dr Kevin Larson of Microsoft and Dr Rosalind Picard of MIT that explored the effects of good typography on mood: </p>

<blockquote>
<p>Two versions of the New Yorker ePeriodical were created. One was typeset well and the other poorly … [the doctors] engaged twenty volunteers — half male, half female — and showed the good version to half of the participants. The other half saw the poor version. The doctors found that, “there are important differences between good and poor typography that appear to have little effect on common performance measures such as reading speed and comprehension.” In short, good typography didn’t help people read faster or comprehend better … [the doctors] also found that “the participants who received the good typography performed better on relative subjective duration and on certain cognitive tasks”, and that “good typography induces a good mood.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In summary, between the volunteers who read the bad typographyical layout and those that read the good typographographical layout, there were no differences in reading speed or comprehension. However, those volunteers who read the good typographical layout <em>perceived</em> it as an easier task and were induced to a good mood.</p>

<p>It can thus be inferred that setting type without regard to contrast, font size, kearning, leading, and so forth, is still functional. It still works. People can still read bad typographic layouts without much difference in &quot;reading speed and comprehension&quot;.</p>

<p>Hence, taking the time to incorporate principles of good typography in your designs won&#39;t necessarily improve readers&#39; comprehension. It will, however, leave people feeling good (though they may not know why). And as web designers, that is a goal worth striving for! We are not creating software. We are not making things beautiful. <strong>We are designing experiences.</strong> Expereinces that leave people feeling good.</p>

<p>And if inducing a good mood isn&#39;t reason enough to invest in good typography, the study also proved that good typography made people &quot;more capable of completeing creative tasks faster&quot;. </p>

<p>So if your app helps people accomplish tasks, especially creative ones, you had better consider the positive effects of great typography!</p>

<p>Remember that there are already too many things out there. We don&#39;t need more things, we need things that work well. </p>

<p>I&#39;ve recently been reading Smashing Magazine&#39;s <a href="https://shop.smashingmagazine.com/smashing-book-3.html">Smashing Book #3</a> and found Aral Balkan&#39;s chapter <em><a href="http://mobile.smashingmagazine.com/2012/06/18/mobile-considerations-in-user-experience-design-web-or-native/">Mobile Considerations in User Experience Design: “Web or Native?”</a></em> quite intriguing. His arguments might even persuade you to believe the web isn&#39;t the platform of the future so many have predicted it to be, but I won&#39;t argue that point here.</p>

<p>Balkan&#39;s article reminded me of our feverish platitudes in the tech world that often blind us to users&#39; needs, wants, and expectations. Talk of open vs. closed systems, why the web is better because of it&#39;s universal accessibility, and other arguments may influence why a <em>developer</em> chooses one system or platform over another. However, the rationale and justification that informs the choices we make as creators of technology rarely bears any weight with  incognizant users of technology.</p>

<p>As Balkan points out, who cares what platform your application runs on if it runs badly? Ok some developers and tech evangelists probably care, but outside of them who cares? </p>

<p>&quot;Crap, my widget crashed and lost all my form data, but that&#39;s ok. These guys built this app using open technology of the web so I&#39;m gonna give this product a break and keep using it.&quot; Said no normal user, ever.</p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>So you&#39;ve got to create an icon for the iOS ecosystem, where do you start? You probably realized quickly you&#39;ll have to supply a couple different sizes for the various contexts in which the icon will be used. Apple details these requirements in their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/IconsImages/IconsImages.html">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1024x1024</strong> Recommended for iTunes Artwork</li>
<li><strong>512x512</strong> Required for iTunes Artwork</li>
<li><strong>144x144</strong> Retina iPad</li>
<li><strong>114x114</strong> Retina iPhone/iPod Touch</li>
<li><strong>72x72</strong> iPad</li>
<li><strong>57x57</strong> iPhone/iPod Touch</li>
</ul>

<p>You don&#39;t actually have to create rounded corners for your icon artwork. Apple will do that for you automatically in all contexts, from iOS to the App Store. However, for other other uses outside of iOS (such as a marketing site) you&#39;re going to have to create an icon with rounded edges yourself.</p>

<h2>Creating the Icon</h2>

<p>So how do you actually get started creating an icon? Well, the amazing icon designer <a href="http://www.pixelresort.com/">Michael Flarup</a> has created a great <a href="http://appicontemplate.com/">iOS icon starter template</a> with proper iOS-style proportions and radii. </p>

<p>But what if you have to create an icon size that doesn&#39;t quite fall into Apple&#39;s predetermined sizes, say 175x175 pixels? How do you determine what size the border radius will be at any given size?</p>

<p>Well, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/drbarnard">David Barnard</a>&#39;s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2105289/iphone-app-icons-exact-radius/10239376#10239376">post over at stackoverflow</a>, we have insight into how the border radius for iOS icons is determined by Apple. According to Barnard, Apple calculates the border radius for icons starting at the 57px icon size (one can only assume that is because the size of icons on the original iPhone was 57px):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple starts with the 57px icon and a radius of 10 then scales up or down from there. Thus you can calculate the radius for any icon size using 10/57 x new size</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, to achieve the correct iOS-style border radius on any square icon you simply multiply the icon&#39;s size by what I&#39;ll call the <strong>iOS icon ratio</strong>. This ratio is calculated from Barnard&#39;s insight: 57 / 10 = .175438596</p>

<p>For simplicity, we can probably round this to about four or five decimal places: <strong>.17544</strong>. This ratio will help you calculate the border-radius for any size iOS style icon you&#39;re creating.</p>

<h2>CSS Application</h2>

<p>Using this logic, you could easily style any image to have an iOS icon feel by applying a CSS border radius with a value of the iOS icon ratio.</p>

<p>Because the <code>border-radius</code> rule will accept a percentage value, we simply tranlate our ratio of .17544 to a percentage: <strong>17.544%</strong>. So our CSS would look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">img {
    border-radius: 17.544%;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/border-radius-ratio.png" alt="Border radius ratio example"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this technique only works in modern-browsers that accept the border-radius rule (no IE support). Also, it&#39;s worth note that some earlier versions of modern browsers didn&#39;t quite apply the border radius correctly when applied directly to an image (as they wouldn&#39;t mask out the edges). So proper browser testing is encouraged if you decide to implement this technique.</p>

<h2>Update - July 31, 2013</h2>

<p>Icon sizes and border radii in iOS7 have been changed by Apple. As outlined in their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1">documentation</a>, icon sizes are now as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1024x1024</strong> Required for App Store</li>
<li><strong>152x152</strong> Retina iPad</li>
<li><strong>120x120</strong> Retina iPhone/iPod Touch</li>
<li><strong>76x76</strong> iPad 2 &amp; iPad Mini</li>
</ul>

<p>You can reference a comparison table of iOS7 icon sizes and iOS 6 icons sizes in Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/App-RelatedResources/App-RelatedResources.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1">developer library</a>.</p>

<p>As for the border radius, the discussion surrounding the exact mathematical formula for how the border radius is drawn is <a href="http://www.mani.de/backstage/?p=483">still uncertain</a>. Until we know for sure, Michael Flarup’s <a href="http://www.pixelresort.com/blog/start-making-ios-7-icons-with-the-app-icon-template-3-0/">overview of iOS7 icons</a> is probably your best resource.</p>

        <p>These are just some excerpts from articles, posts, and books I&#39;ve read recently that stood out to me. Perhaps they&#39;ll grab your interest.</p>

<h2><a href="http://rdd.me/qdjsnbxv">The Flight From Conversation</a></h2>

<p>Article of interesting observations written by Sherry Turkel at the New York Times. It details, among other things, how we have &quot;sacrificed conversation for mere connection&quot;. </p>

<h3>Curating our digital selves</h3>

<p>Interesting parallel of the digital world to the real world of advertising in which, as we all know, famous faces on magazines are never quite as they appear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Texting and e-mail and posting let us present the self we want to be. This means we can edit. And if we wish to, we can delete. Or retouch: the voice, the flesh, the face, the body. Not too much, not too little — just right.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>True self reflection requires trust</h3>

<p>Why it&#39;s so hard to find (or post) anything of deep import amongst in the world of social statuses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These days, social media continually asks us what’s “on our mind,” but we have little motivation to say something truly self-reflective. Self-reflection in conversation requires trust. It’s hard to do anything with 3,000 Facebook friends except connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>We expect more from tech and less from each other</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>We expect more from technology and less from one another and seem increasingly drawn to technologies that provide the illusion of companionship without the demands of relationship. Always-on/always-on-you devices provide three powerful fantasies: that we will always be heard; that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; and that we never have to be alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sharing proves existence, a la Shakespeare</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I share, therefore I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, our internet culture has led many to believe that if they don&#39;t share online they will be left out. They&#39;ll be forgotten. They&#39;ll cease to exist socially. </p>

<p>On a related note - Paul Miller, a journalist at The Verge, has made some interesting observations about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/26/3555640/offline-missing-out-paul-miller/in/2771566">our innate desire to not miss out</a>. He observes that, when we &#39;miss out&#39; on one thing (the internet), we get to spend our attention on something else (perhaps of greater import).</p>

<h3>Ode to a time long gone</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Not too long ago, people walked with their heads up, looking at the water, the sky, the sand and at one another, talking. Now they often walk with their heads down, typing. Even when they are with friends, partners, [and] children</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://rdd.me/2r4jlwcs">Dear Business, I&#39;m scared for you</a></h2>

<p>This article by Brian Hoff at The Design Cubicle is probably <strong>the best post</strong>  describing the web design field I&#39;ve read in a while. </p>

<p>Businesses will spend $40,000 a year on an employee who works eight to five, five days a week. However, for lack of education they won&#39;t spend $1,000 on their hardest-working employee: their website. It works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and interfaces with more clients than any other employee (perhaps even <em>all</em> their employees combined).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your website is not a feature that you can half-ass. Spend some money. Protect your future. A good website works hard for your business. Much harder than many employees can offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2012/11/19/creating-a-thriving-developer-culture/">Creating a Thriving Developer Culture</a></h2>

<p>I&#39;ve worked at Arc90 (and technically still do) and I can verify Alex&#39;s observations. There truly is a thriving developer culture at Arc that exists because of the company traits he points out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When your employee gets up in the morning, you want the most exciting thing in her day to be related to your company ... When your employee discovers something cool, you want their second thought to be “how can I use this at work?”.</p>

            <p class="excerpt">The new tab preview experience in Safari 6 might be better if it *revealed more* of the tab previews as it grows horizontally rather than increasing the size of the tab previews.</p>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Apple&#39;s Safari 6 introduced a new tab switching experience. By activating the feature, Safari presents you with a bird&#39;s-eye view of open tabs. 100% of the active tab is previewable while only about 15% of it&#39;s left and right sibilings are previeweable.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/safari6-tab-view.jpg" alt="Safari 6 tab preview"></p>

<p>This experience of previewing your tabs is consistent no matter the application&#39;s viewport size. You always see 100% of the active tab and about 15% of it&#39;s left and right siblings.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/safari6-tab-view-resolution-comparison.jpg" alt="Safari 6 tab preview at different resolutions"></p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to see the preview of the active tab&#39;s sibilings grow as the viewport grows horizontally? Essentially, if I had a large monitor I would be able to <strong>see more</strong> of the sibling tabs&#39; previews.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/safari6-tab-view-new-design.jpg" alt="New design of Safari 6 tab preview"></p>

<p>As you can see, as the window grows in size horizontally it would <strong>reveal more</strong> of the sibilng tabs&#39; previews <strong>rather than increase</strong> the tab preview sizes. Visually this would help form a more cohesive mental model of the spacial relationship between tabs. It would also help tremendously for any site-comparison a user might be doing.</p>

        <p>In a radio series from the 1940’s, author E.M. Forster stated that the books which truly influence us are the ones we are prepared to read, namely those “which have gone a little further down our particular path than we have yet got ourselves.” [^1] Hence a truly moving reading experience is the culimnation of not just <em>what</em> you read but <em>when</em> you read it.</p>

<p>Personally, I love reading with a pen or highlighter on hand. I’m sure I share this sentiment with many others. Navigating books I’ve annotated reminds me of what I learned while reading. Yet there have been countless times I’ve returned to a previously-read passage only to wonder why in the world I highlighted sentence seven and completely left all of paragraph four unmarked. However, now I realize that as I experience more of life (getting to know myself, my neighbors, my career, my friends, my world) I come to see and understand aspects of life very differently. </p>

<p>As just one example, I used to gloss over snippets of javascript or terminal commands deeming them the writings of a foreign language. However, I now scrupulously inspect those snippets for nuggets of knowledge I have not yet discovered.</p>

<p>Seeing, and its ensuing counterpart understanding, come in phases. What you fail to grasp and understand at this point in your development you may later find to be common sense. Be patient. Seeing and understanding come in stages through experience. </p>

<p>A preview of my most recent article over at Webdesign Tuts:</p>

<p>Touch-based interaction devices are the hot topic these days. I hate to burst anyone&#39;s bubble but traditional input methods, like the mouse, aren&#39;t going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>This article will provide you with everything you need to know about using the <code>cursor</code> rule in CSS. Although touch input methods are here to stay, the <code>cursor</code> rule is still very relevant in designing interfaces on the web. </p>

<p>Because the nature of the web demands universality and accessibility, hybrid interfaces that support both touch and traditional input methods are increasingly necessary. Tactful implementation of the CSS <code>cursor</code> rule in design interaction can be a powerful feature of progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t miss the end of the tutorial where I provide a comprehensive visual breakdown of cursor values across devices and platforms.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of my most recent article via Webdesign Tuts:</p>

<p>In designing pixel-perfect interfaces in Photoshop, you’ve no doubt become good friends with the <em>snap to pixels</em> feature for shape layers. It’s a feature so important in UI design that Adobe baked it into the preferences by default in CS6. Unforunately, as you may know, <em>snap to pixels</em> is not available for the ellipse tool. </p>

<p>So if you’ve ever caught yourself creating circles in Photoshop thinking “gosh, I wish there were <em>snap to pixels</em> for the ellipse tool” then look no further! Your wish has been granted.</p>
