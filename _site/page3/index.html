    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Compressing your CSS for production websites is a best-practice, especially if you&#39;re using a CSS preprocessor like Compass. If you don&#39;t compress your CSS, all your comments (along with stuff from Compass) will show up in your final CSS file. </p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example CSS rule before compression:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">/* line 22, ../../../../../../../../Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/compass-0.12.2/frameworks/compass/stylesheets/compass/reset/_utilities.scss */
// Here&#39;s a comment I have on styling my CSS
a:hover {
        border: 0; // remove border from CSS
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now here&#39;s that same rule compressed:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">a:hover{border:0}
</code></pre></div>
<p>You should already be commenting your code generously. Thus, your CSS file size will increase rather quickly. Here&#39;s a comparison example of CSS file sizes for a project I&#39;m currently working on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prior to compression
    - File size: 122.413kb 
    - Lines of code: 4,601</li>
<li>After compression:
    - File size: 81kb
    - Lines of code: 1</li>
</ul>

<p>To compress using Compass, simply run <code>compass compile -s compressed</code> to strip out all comments and other unnecessary content.</p>

<h2>How Do You Preserve Selective Comments?</h2>

<p>What if you want to preserve specific comments in your CSS? Suppose you want to include licensing information at the beginning of the file, or copyright information, or other required comments, how do you do it?</p>

<h3>Wordpress Example</h3>

<p>When creating a Wordpress theme, you <strong>must</strong> include CSS comments in <code>style.css</code> identifying your theme. It&#39;s usually something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">/*
Theme Name: Twenty Ten
Theme URI: http://wordpress.org/
Description: The 2010 default theme for WordPress.
Author: wordpressdotorg
Author URI: http://wordpress.org/
Version: 1.0
*/
</code></pre></div>
<p>Why? Wordpress uses that information in to identify themes. From the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Development#Theme_Stylesheet">codex</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The stylesheet must provide details about the Theme in the form of comments. <strong>No two Themes are allowed to have the same details</strong> listed in their comment headers, as this will lead to problems in the Theme selection dialog.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So if you&#39;re creating a Wordpress theme, it&#39;s imperative your theme-identifying CSS comments <strong>do not</strong> get stripped out during compression. </p>

<h3>The Solution</h3>

<p>To ensure specific CSS comments are included in a compressed file, make the first letter of a comment <code>!</code>. According to the <a href="http://sass-lang.com/docs/yardoc/file.SASS_REFERENCE.html#comments">SASS documentation</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>When the first letter of a comment is !, the comment will be interpolated and always rendered into css output even in compressed output modes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thus, in the example above, your Wordpress comments would go something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">/*!
Theme Name: Twenty Ten
Theme URI: http://wordpress.org/
Description: The 2010 default theme for WordPress.
Author: wordpressdotorg
Author URI: http://wordpress.org/
Version: 1.0
*/
</code></pre></div>
<p>Compass will now preserve that comment block when compressing your CSS. </p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Fact: the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060891548"><em>On Writing Well</em></a> by William Zinsser is simply stellar. His advice on writing is insightful and succinct. In addition, his thoughts on writing spill into other areas of life.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s two thoughts I found relevant to design:</p>

<h2>Designing is Not a Contest</h2>

<blockquote>
<p>Every writer is starting from a different point and is bound for a different destination. Yet many writers are paralyzed by the thought that they are competing with everybody else who is trying to write and presumably doing better.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This feeling of competition is often fostered in designers who see the work of associates being displayed in galleries while their own work gets no recognition. </p>

<p>Forget everyone else and go at your own pace. Nobody else is solving the exact design problem you are. Your problem is unique; hence your solution should be too. Your only contest is with yourself.</p>

<h2>Just Get Rid of It</h2>

<p>Have you ever tried adding a design element only to find it extremely frustrating to do so? You put the element through all kinds of exertions: you move it to various locations, you resize and reform its structure, you change its colors, you add supporting elements in hopes of clarify its purpose, only to find the overall design worse than where you started?</p>

<p>Zinsser says writers often encounter a similar impasse in constructing sentences. The solution? Get rid of the problem element. Unfortunately, this is usually our solution of last resort:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>look at the troublesome element and ask, &quot;do I need it at all?&quot; Probably you don&#39;t. It was trying to do an unnecessary job all along - thats why it was giving you so much grief. Remove it and watch the afflicted sentence spring to life and breathe normally. It&#39;s the quickest cure and often the best. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes, the best solution is to get rid of the design element you&#39;re trying so hard to include.</p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Do you use <a href="http://scriptogr.am/">Scriptogr.am</a>? Do you want to programmatically retrieve your most recent posts from the service using PHP? It&#39;s not as simple as an API call, but it can be done.</p>

<h2>Before We Begin: The Javascript Method</h2>

<p>In case you&#39;re interested, <a href="http://sicanstudios.com/post/recent-posts-scriptogram/">Alex at sicanstudios</a> has a great tutorial on how to retrieve and display your most recent Scriptogr.am posts using javascript.</p>

<h2>The PHP Method</h2>

<p>Scriptogr.am does not have a publicly accessible API. It does, however, provide an XML feed for each user. You can access your feed URL using this format:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">http://scriptogr.am/USERNAME/feed/
</code></pre></div>
<p>If you use PHP&#39;s <code>file_get_contents()</code> and pass it your Scriptogr.am feed URL, you&#39;ll be returned your most recent posts and accompanying metadata in XML form. </p>

<h3>Converting XML to JSON in PHP</h3>

<p>Now that we have the data we want, we&#39;ve got to put it in the format we want (JSON). We can do that using the technique described in <a href="http://lostechies.com/seanbiefeld/2011/10/21/simple-xml-to-json-with-php/">this article from lostechies</a>.</p>

<h2>Cut to the Chase: The Code</h2>

<p>Here&#39;s the final PHP snippet that does everything we&#39;ve described above. Just change the <code>$username</code> value to your own Scriptogr.am username and you&#39;re good to go!</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">function get_scriptogram_JSON() {
    $username = &#39;jimniels&#39;;
    $url = &#39;http://scriptogr.am/&#39;. $username .&#39;/feed/&#39;;
    $fileContents = file_get_contents($url);
    $fileContents = str_replace(array(&quot;\n&quot;, &quot;\r&quot;, &quot;\t&quot;), &#39;&#39;, $fileContents);
    $fileContents = trim(str_replace(&#39;&quot;&#39;, &quot;&#39;&quot;, $fileContents));
    $simpleXml = simplexml_load_string($fileContents);
    $json = json_encode($simpleXml);
    return $json;
}
</code></pre></div>
    </div>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Neil Postman, in his book <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Technopoly-The-Surrender-Culture-Technology/dp/0679745408">Technopoly: The Surrender of Culture to Technology</a></em>, tells the story of how advertisers in the late 1800&#39;s began to realize marketing products isn&#39;t about extolling the benefits of the products themselves. Rather, effective advertising is, as Postman remarks, about using the persuasive power of language and photographs:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Advertising is most effective when it is irrational. By irrational, I do not, of course, mean crazy. I mean that products [can] best be sold by exploiting the magical and even poetical powers of language and pictures. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Postman uses the word &quot;irrational&quot; to reveal how advertisers previously employed logic and reason to sell products. However, they soon realized that compelling language and photographs were more powerful in consumers&#39; minds than logic and reason; hence the irrationality of advertising:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>By the turn of the century, advertisers no longer assumed that reason was the best instrument for the communication of commercial products and ideas. Advertising became one part depth psychology, one part aesthetic theory. In the process, a fundamental principle of capitalist ideology was rejected: namely, that the producer and consumer were engaged in a rational enterprise in which consumers made choices on the basis of a careful consideration of the quality of a product and their own self-interest. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This rejection of rationality in consumer enterprise led to the type of advertising we have today, where commercials and ads aren&#39;t about the products being sold but rather the character of the consumers viewing the ad:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today, the television commercial, for example, is rarely about the character of the products. It is about the character of the consumers of products. Images of movie stars and famous athletes, of serene lakes and macho fishing trips, of elegant dinners and romantic interludes, of happy families packing their station wagons for a picnic in the country — these tell nothing about the products being sold. But they tell everything about the fears, fancies, and dreams of those who might buy them. <strong>What the advertiser needs to know is not what is right about the product but what is wrong about the buyer.</strong> And so the balance of business expenditures shifts from product research to market research, <strong>which means orienting business away from making products of value and toward making consumers feel valuable.</strong> The business of business becomes pseudo-therapy; the consumer, a patient reassured by psychodramas. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

    <div class="content">
        <p>Take a look at this:</p>

<p><code>*</code></p>

<p>In CSS terms, that&#39;s the universal selector. Are warning sirens relating to performance sounding in your head? Are you feeling emotions of avoidance, like you do when you see <code>!important</code>? It&#39;s possible you do. The universal selector carries a negative stigma of poor performance. But should it? <a href="http://paulirish.com/2012/box-sizing-border-box-ftw/">Paul Irish answers</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apparently you’ve heard its slow. Firstly, it’s not. It is as fast as <code>h1</code> as a selector. It can be slow when you specifically use it like <code>.foo &gt;</code> , so don’t do that</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It can be slow, but mostly it&#39;s not. Still, that may seem like reason enough in your mind to avoid using (or misusing) it. Stop thinking that way. Turn those &quot;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Danger,_Will_Robinson">Danger, Will Robison!</a>&quot; sirens off. Don&#39;t be afraid to use it. Why? Paul Irish continues:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>You are not allowed to care about the performance of <code>*</code> unless you concatenate all your javascript, have it at the bottom, minify your css and js, gzip all your assets, and losslessly compress all your images.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s important to remember that general rules of thumb, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>don&#39;t use the <code>*</code> selector, it&#39;s slow</li>
<li>don&#39;t use the <code>!important</code> rule</li>
</ul>

<p>are rules discovered and shared by developers working on immensely large scale applications and websites, like Google.com. Some rules just don&#39;t apply to your ten page Wordpress site. </p>

<p>The <code>*</code> and <code>!important</code> rules were invented for a reason. If you find yourself needing them, use them. That&#39;s what they were made for. If page performance takes a hit, look into larger-scale optimization techniques first, such as image optimization and concatenation. After that, you can get down to the nit-picky. In general, <a href="http://calendar.perfplanet.com/2011/css-selector-performance-has-changed-for-the-better/">optimization of selectors should be the job of the rendering engine</a>, not the designer.</p>
