<p>All I could see in this video is Google Glass&#39; potential for frustration. My experience in paying for a coffee would most likely go something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: [<em>me paying for coffee, speaking to glass</em>] Ok glass, pay for coffee, use my credit card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Using debit card ending in 4516<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: No glass, I said <em>credit</em> card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Which credit card would you like to use?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: My American Express<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Which American Express would you like to use?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: My gold card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Error. Sorry, you don&#39;t have a &quot;gold&quot; American Express card. Valid types are cards ending in: 4512 and 7483<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I don&#39;t know, use the card ending in 4512<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Processing … transaction cancelled. Trying again … it appears you don&#39;t have any money on this card. Trying American Express card ending in 7483 … processing<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: [<em>speaking to cashier</em>] Sorry, it will just take another second, my card isn&#39;t going through. I always have trouble with that card. American Express always stops transactions on it, I wonder if it&#39;s beca...<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Stopping transaction...<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: No Glass! I wasn&#39;t talking to you. Keep using that card.<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Transaction stopped. What would you like to do now?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Ok Glass, let&#39;s try this again. Pay for coffee.<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: You don&#39;t have any valid credit cards, but you can add a new one. What&#39;s the number?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I don&#39;t&#39; want to say my credit card number out loud.<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Error. What do you want to do now?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Damnit glass. Ok pay for coffee. Use PayPal<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Password please?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Damnit I can&#39;t say my password here in front of everyone!<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Password please?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Ugh, damn you glass.<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: [<em>speaking to cashier</em>] I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m going to have to just not get this coffee<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: [<em>walking out the door, speaking to glass</em>] How much does a used Google Glass go for on eBay?<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Searching Google for used glass gophers on eBay  </p>

        <p>When an idea strikes, what do you do with it? The commonly-held belief is that you sketch the idea on paper, as a sort of refinement process. Why? Because ideas, especially visual ones, are conceptually rough and difficult to articulate. Sketching an idea on paper can be a process of refinement. Through sketching, an idea becomes sufficiently polished to warrant actual implementation.</p>

<p>However, there is another purpose to sketching that is often overlooked. Sketching isn&#39;t always about slowly shaping and fine-tuning a single idea. In Smashing Magazine&#39;s recent publication <em><a href="http://www.the-mobile-book.com/">The Mobile Book</a></em>, Dennis Kardys writes a chapter called “Hands on Design for Mobile” in which he points out this disparate purpose to ideation and sketching:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We often think of sketching as a way to generate and communicate ideas, but it can also be a weapon to dismantle them. The goal of sketching ... isn’t to produce drawings that inform the final design ... The goal is to drive out those stubborn, thorny ideas and make room for new ones. Only then can we look anew and achieve a deeper understanding of what we’re designing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you work with ideas like a mason works with stone. You start with a large, unformed block of stone and slowly chip away at it until you arrive at the finished product. However, sometimes you work with ideas like a farmer doing a controlled burn. You burn everything down to make room for new growth. Only then do you see anew things hidden beforehand. </p>

<p>Here’s <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/filler-content-tools-tips-and-a-dynamic-example/">a link</a> to my most recent article. I talk about how to leverage filler content in your design process.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Because a lot of website design used to take place in Photoshop, manually copying/pasting text from the web was the best method for ‘filling in’ a design with dummy content. However, now that a lot of website design takes place in the browser, why not have the computer do all ‘filling in’ work for you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It&#39;s a new era for designing in the browser. See how by reading <a href="http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/tutorials/htmlcss-tutorials/filler-content-tools-tips-and-a-dynamic-example/">Filler Content: Tools, Tips and a Dynamic Example</a>.</p>

        <p>Have you ever felt exhausted by infinite scrolling?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Infinite scrolling merely tempts you to continue reading, wasting time and decreasing productivity in the process ... Even more annoying is that scroll bars do not reflect the actual amount of data available. You’ll scroll down happily assuming you are close to the bottom, which by itself tempts you to scroll that little bit more, only to find that the results have just doubled by the time you get there. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&#39;ve encountered this many times. It&#39;s exhausting. The worst part is that you keep telling yourself “just a little further” because you perpetually see the scroll bar two-thirds of the way down the page and don&#39;t want to feel as though you&#39;re missing out on any information.</p>

<p>Yogev Ahuvia wrote <a href="http://uxdesign.smashingmagazine.com/2013/05/03/infinite-scrolling-get-bottom/">a great article over at Smashing Magazine</a> that analyzes the benefits and drawbacks of using infinite scrolling. It&#39;s worth a read. </p>

    <!-- Article Content

    <div class="content">
        <p>Establishing a grid is a great way to organize and structure design elements. In addition, by breaking the organization and structure of the grid you can emphasize visual relationships between design elements.</p>

<h2>Drawbacks to Grids</h2>

<p>Recently I came across a subtle and often overlooked side-effect of grid-based design: unintended visual relationships. An example of this can be found in the Wordpress theme <a href="http://wpshower.com/themes/portfolium/">Portfolium</a> </p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium.jpg" alt="Portfolium Screenshot"></p>

<p>Overall, it&#39;s a well executed grid-based design: organized and structured; however, the alignment of the navigation to the thumbnail grid suggests visual relationships that are nonexistent. </p>

<p>For example, take a look at the words at the top of the page: they align to the thumbnail grid. This suggests a columnar relationship between each navigation item and the thumbnails  below them. However, no such relationship actually exists.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-grid-alignment.jpg" alt="Portfolium Grid Alignment"></p>

<h2>Rows, Columns, or Neither?</h2>

<p>This type of unintended visual alignment is confusing. The words in the navigation align with the columns below them, suggesting some type of organization or categorization. Even the light grey lines below navigation item are visually separated which helps reinforce the idea of a column layout. Even so, there is no relationship between the navigation items and the thumbnails below them.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you wanted to suggest a relationship between the navigation items and the thumbnails below them, the alignment of Portfolium would be ideal. For example, if you wanted to separate and categorize the thumbnails by column, this type of alignment would work very well:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-categories.jpg" alt="Portfolium Categories"></p>

<h2>A Better Alignment</h2>

<p>In the example of Portfolium, not aligning the navigation to the thumbnail grid would break the grid and provide a visual separation between the sections of image thumbnails and navigation. In addition, making the light grey line at the top a solid, unbroken line helps visually separate the header from the content.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/portfolium-new.jpg" alt="Altered Portfolium Screenshot"></p>

<p>It&#39;s possible that the creators of Portfolium had a purpose in mind when designing the theme the way they did. However, I don&#39;t see it. Take care to always be aware of how your grid elements are being aligned. In grid-based design, it&#39;s easy to unintentionally suggest visual relationship that don&#39;t exist.</p>
