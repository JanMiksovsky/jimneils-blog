        <p>In a radio series from the 1940’s, author E.M. Forster stated that the books which truly influence us are the ones we are prepared to read, namely those “which have gone a little further down our particular path than we have yet got ourselves.” [^1] Hence a truly moving reading experience is the culimnation of not just <em>what</em> you read but <em>when</em> you read it.</p>

<p>Personally, I love reading with a pen or highlighter on hand. I’m sure I share this sentiment with many others. Navigating books I’ve annotated reminds me of what I learned while reading. Yet there have been countless times I’ve returned to a previously-read passage only to wonder why in the world I highlighted sentence seven and completely left all of paragraph four unmarked. However, now I realize that as I experience more of life (getting to know myself, my neighbors, my career, my friends, my world) I come to see and understand aspects of life very differently. </p>

<p>As just one example, I used to gloss over snippets of javascript or terminal commands deeming them the writings of a foreign language. However, I now scrupulously inspect those snippets for nuggets of knowledge I have not yet discovered.</p>

<p>Seeing, and its ensuing counterpart understanding, come in phases. What you fail to grasp and understand at this point in your development you may later find to be common sense. Be patient. Seeing and understanding come in stages through experience. </p>

<p>A preview of my most recent article over at Webdesign Tuts:</p>

<p>Touch-based interaction devices are the hot topic these days. I hate to burst anyone&#39;s bubble but traditional input methods, like the mouse, aren&#39;t going away anytime soon.</p>

<p>This article will provide you with everything you need to know about using the <code>cursor</code> rule in CSS. Although touch input methods are here to stay, the <code>cursor</code> rule is still very relevant in designing interfaces on the web. </p>

<p>Because the nature of the web demands universality and accessibility, hybrid interfaces that support both touch and traditional input methods are increasingly necessary. Tactful implementation of the CSS <code>cursor</code> rule in design interaction can be a powerful feature of progressive enhancement.</p>

<p>Also, don&#39;t miss the end of the tutorial where I provide a comprehensive visual breakdown of cursor values across devices and platforms.</p>

<p>Here’s a preview of my most recent article via Webdesign Tuts:</p>

<p>In designing pixel-perfect interfaces in Photoshop, you’ve no doubt become good friends with the <em>snap to pixels</em> feature for shape layers. It’s a feature so important in UI design that Adobe baked it into the preferences by default in CS6. Unforunately, as you may know, <em>snap to pixels</em> is not available for the ellipse tool. </p>

<p>So if you’ve ever caught yourself creating circles in Photoshop thinking “gosh, I wish there were <em>snap to pixels</em> for the ellipse tool” then look no further! Your wish has been granted.</p>
