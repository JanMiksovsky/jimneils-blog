        <p>Seemingly high-quality freebies, who doesn&#39;t love them? They save lots of time. However, be careful to double check and properly adjust any small details that may be misaligned. As they say, design is in the details, and sometimes you can&#39;t always rely on someone else having invested in those details.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a vector freebie I got online today. I imported the shape into Photoshop and noticed a 1px offset in symmetry:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/freebie-offset.png" alt="Freebie 1px Offset"></p>

<p>I know you might be thinking, &quot;1px offset? Nobody will even notice that.&quot; And you know what? You&#39;re right. One little 1px offset in an image that&#39;s 16x16 pixels probably won&#39;t be noticed by many people. However, the accumulation of many 1px offsets in your digital creations <strong>will</strong> be noticed! It&#39;s worth practicing some self discipline because it will help avoid sloppy work.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/freebie-offset-select.png" alt="Freebie 1px Offset Shape Selection"></p>

<p>Ahhh, isn&#39;t this much better?</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/freebie-offset-fix.png" alt="Freebie 1px Offset Correction"></p>

<p>Don&#39;t assume the freebie is pixel-perfect, especially when transferring it between software applications. Keeping up your guard and not making assumptions will prevent slipshod work.</p>

        <p>If you&#39;ve ever used InDesign you&#39;ve no doubt used the &quot;Links&quot; panel. It allows you to link and embedd files in your document layout. InDesign keeps track of all the files you&#39;ve embedded and where they live on your hard drive. This gives you the power to relink files, updated modified files, edit the original files, and so forth. For example, say you embedd a logo in InDesign but then you want to modify it. You can go to the Links panel and click &quot;edit original&quot;. Illustrator (or whatever logo editing software you&#39;ve used) will open the file. You make your changes, save it, and go back to InDesign and the logo&#39;s changes will automatically update in your layout.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/links-panel-indesign.png" alt="Links Panel in InDesign"></p>

<p>I found myself wanting this feature in Photoshop. It would be extremely useful for building websites because you could modularize your PSDs. For example, I could create one PSD called <code>header.psd</code> and another called <code>footer.psd</code>. When I want to create a PSD for a new page mockup, I can easily &quot;embedd&quot; the header and footer PSDs into my new document. This allows me to easily spin-off new page mockups based on single PSD files. </p>

<p>So, for example, if I want to change a design element in the header of my website, I only have to change it in one file and it would be replicated in all the PSDs where I&#39;ve embedded <code>header.psd</code>. This is essentially the same thing as creating a file called <code>header.php</code> that has all my main navigation and is called into every page template.</p>

<p>Although InDesign supports this feature, Photoshop does not. However, a Google search led me to these two extensions which have become quite useful.</p>

<ol>
<li><a href="http://www.ps-scripts.com/bb/viewtopic.php?f=27&amp;t=3045&amp;sid=90f57aa35b85d5d38fe52ea551ac4a4c">Smart Object Links Panel</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.canlinkit.com/">CanLinkIt</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I&#39;m not sure what the development status of these are anymore, but they worked for me. Try them out! I think they will save you a lot of time. </p>

<p>Now with PSDs you can edit once and change everywhere!</p>

        <p>Can you really change the world over night?</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In both the web and in our greater community, I see people despair that change doesn’t happen more quickly. That we can’t make the world better overnight. But if this year has taught me anything, it is that we can’t ignore the hard work that needs to be done. And that we all must take up the charge to make the world better than it we found it — both on the web and in our society. - <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/what-we-learned-in-2012">Jason Grigsby</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is so great about the web is that , with a single great idea, you <strong>can</strong> often build it overnight. Or at least in a few days. No bureaucracy. No paperwork. No meetings. No board approval.The <a href="http://lab.arc90.com/hackathon/2012/">Arc90 Hackathon</a> was a good example of this to me.  Get a good idea, start a conversation, excite others, build it, release it to the community, and if its great, you&#39;ll begin sowing the seeds of change. </p>

<p>From there you just iterate.  </p>

    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I needed a star symbol in my design. That&#39;s how this all started. I wanted to use something other than an image to display the star on screen for various reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I wanted the star to be different colors in different contexts and I didn&#39;t want to create an image of the star for each variance. </li>
<li>I wanted the star to be crisp and clear, which meant I&#39;d have to create multiple sizes of the image for retina screen support.</li>
</ol>

<p>So rather than create a handful of stars as images (in different colors and sizes) I decided to try using the black star symbol in Unicode (U+2605, &amp;#9733).</p>

<h2>Unicode and Font Stack Correlations</h2>

<p>I began by simply inserting the character reference in my markup with the default CSS font-size of 1em and font stack of Helvetica. However, I stumbled on an inconsistency in modern browsers: the unicode star was rendering at different sizes in browsers that implement different rendering engines.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/black-star-unicode-arial-helvetica.png" alt="Black Star Unicode Using Helvetica and Arial Unicode MS"></p>

<p>Notice the size difference? It appears the black star unicode symbol is not supported by my default stack of Helvetica. In order to display the character, each browser is resorting to a font of it&#39;s own choosing that <em>does</em> support it. In this case, each browsers is choosing a different font; hence the size discrepancy. </p>

<p>By resorting to a font stack that supports the black star glyph (in this case Arial Unicode MS), I achieved consistent sizing across browsers. You can see the differences and similarities in this blown up photo:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2013/black-star-unicode-arial-helvetica-zoomed.png" alt="Zoomed in Photo of Black Star Unicode Glyph"></p>

<h2>But Wait, There&#39;s Always IE</h2>

<p>Of course, if you&#39;re trying to support IE, throw everything I just said out the window. The black star wasn&#39;t displaying in IE 7 &amp; 8 on Windows XP. This is because Windows XP, by default, didn&#39;t have a font that supports the black star glyph using standard Unicode. However, if the user had additional fonts installed, like the ones that come with MS Office, I&#39;m guessing this technique would probably work. I&#39;ll leave that up to someone else to test.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>If you&#39;re going to use Unicode symbols, make sure you&#39;re using a font that supports them. If you don&#39;t, you&#39;ll find some strange inconsistencies across browsers. Here is Wikipedia&#39;s take:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The Miscellaneous Symbols Unicode block (2600–26FF) contains various glyphs representing things from a variety of categories …  these [characters] may not display properly if your computer does not implement Unicode and have the proper fonts installed. Also, some browsers may not display certain symbols properly at all even if your computer has the required implemented Unicode and fonts. - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols">Wikipedia</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started realizing consistent Unicode support across browsers and platforms was a rabbit&#39;s hole I didn&#39;t want to go down any further. So I switched my implementation technique to <a href="http://css-tricks.com/examples/IconFont/">icon fonts</a>, which was much more bullet-proof.</p>
