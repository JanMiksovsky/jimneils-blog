    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>So you&#39;ve got to create an icon for the iOS ecosystem, where do you start? You probably realized quickly you&#39;ll have to supply a couple different sizes for the various contexts in which the icon will be used. Apple details these requirements in their <a href="http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/IconsImages/IconsImages.html">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1024x1024</strong> Recommended for iTunes Artwork</li>
<li><strong>512x512</strong> Required for iTunes Artwork</li>
<li><strong>144x144</strong> Retina iPad</li>
<li><strong>114x114</strong> Retina iPhone/iPod Touch</li>
<li><strong>72x72</strong> iPad</li>
<li><strong>57x57</strong> iPhone/iPod Touch</li>
</ul>

<p>You don&#39;t actually have to create rounded corners for your icon artwork. Apple will do that for you automatically in all contexts, from iOS to the App Store. However, for other other uses outside of iOS (such as a marketing site) you&#39;re going to have to create an icon with rounded edges yourself.</p>

<h2>Creating the Icon</h2>

<p>So how do you actually get started creating an icon? Well, the amazing icon designer <a href="http://www.pixelresort.com/">Michael Flarup</a> has created a great <a href="http://appicontemplate.com/">iOS icon starter template</a> with proper iOS-style proportions and radii. </p>

<p>But what if you have to create an icon size that doesn&#39;t quite fall into Apple&#39;s predetermined sizes, say 175x175 pixels? How do you determine what size the border radius will be at any given size?</p>

<p>Well, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/drbarnard">David Barnard</a>&#39;s <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2105289/iphone-app-icons-exact-radius/10239376#10239376">post over at stackoverflow</a>, we have insight into how the border radius for iOS icons is determined by Apple. According to Barnard, Apple calculates the border radius for icons starting at the 57px icon size (one can only assume that is because the size of icons on the original iPhone was 57px):</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Apple starts with the 57px icon and a radius of 10 then scales up or down from there. Thus you can calculate the radius for any icon size using 10/57 x new size</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Therefore, to achieve the correct iOS-style border radius on any square icon you simply multiply the icon&#39;s size by what I&#39;ll call the <strong>iOS icon ratio</strong>. This ratio is calculated from Barnard&#39;s insight: 57 / 10 = .175438596</p>

<p>For simplicity, we can probably round this to about four or five decimal places: <strong>.17544</strong>. This ratio will help you calculate the border-radius for any size iOS style icon you&#39;re creating.</p>

<h2>CSS Application</h2>

<p>Using this logic, you could easily style any image to have an iOS icon feel by applying a CSS border radius with a value of the iOS icon ratio.</p>

<p>Because the <code>border-radius</code> rule will accept a percentage value, we simply tranlate our ratio of .17544 to a percentage: <strong>17.544%</strong>. So our CSS would look something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">img {
    border-radius: 17.544%;
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/border-radius-ratio.png" alt="Border radius ratio example"></p>

<p>Unfortunately, this technique only works in modern-browsers that accept the border-radius rule (no IE support). Also, it&#39;s worth note that some earlier versions of modern browsers didn&#39;t quite apply the border radius correctly when applied directly to an image (as they wouldn&#39;t mask out the edges). So proper browser testing is encouraged if you decide to implement this technique.</p>

<h2>Update - July 31, 2013</h2>

<p>Icon sizes and border radii in iOS7 have been changed by Apple. As outlined in their <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/MobileHIG/IconMatrix.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH27-SW1">documentation</a>, icon sizes are now as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>1024x1024</strong> Required for App Store</li>
<li><strong>152x152</strong> Retina iPad</li>
<li><strong>120x120</strong> Retina iPhone/iPod Touch</li>
<li><strong>76x76</strong> iPad 2 &amp; iPad Mini</li>
</ul>

<p>You can reference a comparison table of iOS7 icon sizes and iOS 6 icons sizes in Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/App-RelatedResources/App-RelatedResources.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH6-SW1">developer library</a>.</p>

<p>As for the border radius, the discussion surrounding the exact mathematical formula for how the border radius is drawn is <a href="http://www.mani.de/backstage/?p=483">still uncertain</a>. Until we know for sure, Michael Flarup’s <a href="http://www.pixelresort.com/blog/start-making-ios-7-icons-with-the-app-icon-template-3-0/">overview of iOS7 icons</a> is probably your best resource.</p>

        <p>These are just some excerpts from articles, posts, and books I&#39;ve read recently that stood out to me. Perhaps they&#39;ll grab your interest.</p>

<h2><a href="http://rdd.me/qdjsnbxv">The Flight From Conversation</a></h2>

<p>Article of interesting observations written by Sherry Turkel at the New York Times. It details, among other things, how we have &quot;sacrificed conversation for mere connection&quot;. </p>

<h3>Curating our digital selves</h3>

<p>Interesting parallel of the digital world to the real world of advertising in which, as we all know, famous faces on magazines are never quite as they appear:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Texting and e-mail and posting let us present the self we want to be. This means we can edit. And if we wish to, we can delete. Or retouch: the voice, the flesh, the face, the body. Not too much, not too little — just right.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>True self reflection requires trust</h3>

<p>Why it&#39;s so hard to find (or post) anything of deep import amongst in the world of social statuses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>These days, social media continually asks us what’s “on our mind,” but we have little motivation to say something truly self-reflective. Self-reflection in conversation requires trust. It’s hard to do anything with 3,000 Facebook friends except connect.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>We expect more from tech and less from each other</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>We expect more from technology and less from one another and seem increasingly drawn to technologies that provide the illusion of companionship without the demands of relationship. Always-on/always-on-you devices provide three powerful fantasies: that we will always be heard; that we can put our attention wherever we want it to be; and that we never have to be alone.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3>Sharing proves existence, a la Shakespeare</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>I share, therefore I am.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Unfortunately, our internet culture has led many to believe that if they don&#39;t share online they will be left out. They&#39;ll be forgotten. They&#39;ll cease to exist socially. </p>

<p>On a related note - Paul Miller, a journalist at The Verge, has made some interesting observations about <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2012/10/26/3555640/offline-missing-out-paul-miller/in/2771566">our innate desire to not miss out</a>. He observes that, when we &#39;miss out&#39; on one thing (the internet), we get to spend our attention on something else (perhaps of greater import).</p>

<h3>Ode to a time long gone</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Not too long ago, people walked with their heads up, looking at the water, the sky, the sand and at one another, talking. Now they often walk with their heads down, typing. Even when they are with friends, partners, [and] children</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://rdd.me/2r4jlwcs">Dear Business, I&#39;m scared for you</a></h2>

<p>This article by Brian Hoff at The Design Cubicle is probably <strong>the best post</strong>  describing the web design field I&#39;ve read in a while. </p>

<p>Businesses will spend $40,000 a year on an employee who works eight to five, five days a week. However, for lack of education they won&#39;t spend $1,000 on their hardest-working employee: their website. It works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year and interfaces with more clients than any other employee (perhaps even <em>all</em> their employees combined).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Your website is not a feature that you can half-ass. Spend some money. Protect your future. A good website works hard for your business. Much harder than many employees can offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2><a href="http://blog.arc90.com/2012/11/19/creating-a-thriving-developer-culture/">Creating a Thriving Developer Culture</a></h2>

<p>I&#39;ve worked at Arc90 (and technically still do) and I can verify Alex&#39;s observations. There truly is a thriving developer culture at Arc that exists because of the company traits he points out. </p>

<blockquote>
<p>When your employee gets up in the morning, you want the most exciting thing in her day to be related to your company ... When your employee discovers something cool, you want their second thought to be “how can I use this at work?”.</p>
</blockquote>

            <p class="excerpt">The new tab preview experience in Safari 6 might be better if it *revealed more* of the tab previews as it grows horizontally rather than increasing the size of the tab previews.</p>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content

    <div class="content">
        <p>Apple&#39;s Safari 6 introduced a new tab switching experience. By activating the feature, Safari presents you with a bird&#39;s-eye view of open tabs. 100% of the active tab is previewable while only about 15% of it&#39;s left and right sibilings are previeweable.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/safari6-tab-view.jpg" alt="Safari 6 tab preview"></p>

<p>This experience of previewing your tabs is consistent no matter the application&#39;s viewport size. You always see 100% of the active tab and about 15% of it&#39;s left and right siblings.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/safari6-tab-view-resolution-comparison.jpg" alt="Safari 6 tab preview at different resolutions"></p>

<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be neat to see the preview of the active tab&#39;s sibilings grow as the viewport grows horizontally? Essentially, if I had a large monitor I would be able to <strong>see more</strong> of the sibling tabs&#39; previews.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/img/2012/safari6-tab-view-new-design.jpg" alt="New design of Safari 6 tab preview"></p>

<p>As you can see, as the window grows in size horizontally it would <strong>reveal more</strong> of the sibilng tabs&#39; previews <strong>rather than increase</strong> the tab preview sizes. Visually this would help form a more cohesive mental model of the spacial relationship between tabs. It would also help tremendously for any site-comparison a user might be doing.</p>

        <p>In a radio series from the 1940’s, author E.M. Forster stated that the books which truly influence us are the ones we are prepared to read, namely those “which have gone a little further down our particular path than we have yet got ourselves.” [^1] Hence a truly moving reading experience is the culimnation of not just <em>what</em> you read but <em>when</em> you read it.</p>

<p>Personally, I love reading with a pen or highlighter on hand. I’m sure I share this sentiment with many others. Navigating books I’ve annotated reminds me of what I learned while reading. Yet there have been countless times I’ve returned to a previously-read passage only to wonder why in the world I highlighted sentence seven and completely left all of paragraph four unmarked. However, now I realize that as I experience more of life (getting to know myself, my neighbors, my career, my friends, my world) I come to see and understand aspects of life very differently. </p>

<p>As just one example, I used to gloss over snippets of javascript or terminal commands deeming them the writings of a foreign language. However, I now scrupulously inspect those snippets for nuggets of knowledge I have not yet discovered.</p>

<p>Seeing, and its ensuing counterpart understanding, come in phases. What you fail to grasp and understand at this point in your development you may later find to be common sense. Be patient. Seeing and understanding come in stages through experience. </p>
