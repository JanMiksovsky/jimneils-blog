    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I was recently reading “The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin” and came across an interesting little story that made me think of Benjamin Franklin as a believer in open source.</p>

<p>Back in the 1700’s, Franklin invented an open stove that vastly improved the warming of rooms while simultaneously saving more fuel. He presented the model to friends and wrote a pamphlet about it which garnered him a lot of attention and positive publicity. His invention and writing had such a good effect that even the governor of Philadelphia used his stove and loved it. Here’s what happened next:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Gov’r Thomas was so pleas’d with the construction of this stove ... that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declin’d it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think we could all do to forget the monetary incentives behind innovative inventions and put human beings and their benefit back at the center of our daily purposes. As Paul Rand says, “It is only when man is not accepted as the centre of human concern that it becomes feasible to create a system of production which values profit out of proportion to responsible public service”.</p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>John Mayer, an incredibly influential and accomplished guitarist, speaks about the evolution of his personal skill set in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mm8G5-pug_w">this recording at Abbey Road</a>. These were a few points I found fascinating is his commentary on creativity:</p>

<ul>
<li>Personal development comes about through failure, often times in the failure to imitate someone else’s success.</li>
<li>Exponential development of any skill is easy at the outset, but that type of rapid improvement doesn’t last forever.</li>
<li>It takes a lot of time — years — to develop your own creative style.</li>
<li>Whatever you’re producing changes over the years. The work of year one is different than the work of year ten which is different than the work of year fifteen.</li>
<li>Learning the technical side of creativity is the easy part. You spend the rest of your life learning how to employ those technical skills.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s my transcript of the video:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Well when you&#39;re first starting out with something like guitar, like an instrument, like anything really, you can just keep doubling your capacity by the week. You’re 100% better next month, then 100% better the next month compared to the beginning. So I was completely enamored with that and wasn&#39;t into singing or writing or doing anything I was just in a kind of hands-on bootcamp for playing guitar. <br><br> About 17 years old I wanted to start writing songs and I realized I didn’t know anyone who could sing them. So I just started right in trying to sing and it was … [shakes head in disgust]. It took a lot of years to develop a more boiled-down vocal sound. You develop a style when you fail to sound exactly like the person you’re trying to sound like. Even in the songs I try to cover sometimes I’ll be really afraid that it’s a facsimile of the original song and then I go back and listen to the original song and I realize how many of my own instincts have made their way into there. So a lot of it is accidental, you know? What’s really interesting in the growth of all this is that I have gotten to be a better singer within the arc of my records. The way I sang in my first record is completely different from the way I’ve been singing in the last couple. I think now I’ve kinda found my way. Singing is a sticky and kind of hard-to-manage thing sometimes.<br><br> I don’t get twice as good on the guitar these days, you know, I haven’t for a while. But what I’m picking up now are the kind of like zen things, just in terms of thinking, because I have the technical side down now. It’s just a matter of ‘how does that implant itself in my mind’. And that’s kind of the ultimate - that you spend the rest of your life figuring out.</p>

    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>Wired recently did <a href="http://www.wired.com/underwire/2013/10/center_of_gravity/">an interview with Alfonso Cuarón</a>, the director of the film <em>Gravity</em>. Cuarón relates how making the film took four and a half years. When asked why it was so difficult, he responded:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We had to do the whole film as an animation first. We edited that animation, even with sound, just to make sure the timing worked with the sound effects and music. And once we were happy with it, we had to do the lighting in the animation as well. Then all that animation translated to actual camera moves and positions for the lighting and actors. <strong>We did a whole exploration of the screenplay, every single moment; we made judgments about everything.</strong> Once we began shooting, we were constrained by the limitations of that programming. (emphasis added)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Did you catch that? Before it was filmed the entire movie was, in the terms of web designers, wireframed. </p>

<p>Now I am not familiar with the world of film production, but I can see “wireframing movies” becoming an extremely popular practice based solely on the explorative, iterative nature of wireframes. This would allow directors to explore timing, camera angles, plot development, and other valuable components that constitute great film making.</p>

<p>Similarly, as web designers, I think we would do well to imitate this same exploratory process in designing online experiences. Wireframing an entire website or experience can help explore every single moment of interaction and allow you (the designer) to make better, more informed decisions on molding the components of your website, like information architecture, URL design, animatable interactions, and so forth.</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="/jim-nielsen.com/blog/posts/ostentatious-design-and-profanity">Ostentatious Design & Profanity</a></h1>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I’m not sure why, but people love to curse. In fact, curse words are losing their potency and becoming increasingly banal because of overuse.</p>

<p>For example, my Dad rarely cursed. When he did, it was never anything more than ‘damn’ or ‘hell’. However, when he used those words you knew he was mad. And if by some chance he said ‘shit’, well then you had better get as far away as possible because he was mad as a hornet (most likely from striking his thumb with a hammer). Now-a-days, it seems as though the use of profanity really gives no intimation into someone’s mood.</p>

<h2>Profanity in Human Language</h2>

<p>Profanity is the part of language that many consider impolite, offensive, or vulgar. Its use is to either <strong>a)</strong> show crude debasement of someone or something, or <strong>b)</strong> show strong or intense emotions. Excessive vulgarity is quite detrimental to character, it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Gives a bad impression</li>
<li>Makes for unpleasant company</li>
<li>Is a tool for whiners and complainers</li>
<li>Is disrespectful</li>
<li>Reveals lack of self-control and character</li>
<li>Is immature, uneducated, and unsophisticated</li>
<li>Sets a bad example</li>
<li>Contributes to a decline in civility</li>
<li>Is offensive and abrasive</li>
<li>Can easily be interpreted as a gesture of hostility</li>
<li>Corrosive to human language</li>
<li>Is not effectively expressive; neglects better word choices and lacks imagination</li>
</ul>

<h2>An Example of Ostentatious Design</h2>

<p>This app is called <a href="http://www.authenticweather.com/">Authentic Weather</a> and it’s censored by Apple’s app store for vulgarity:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Authentic-Weather-for-iOS/10324571"><img src="http://a5.mzstatic.com/us/r30/Purple6/v4/93/b3/da/93b3da38-9daf-fd31-fd1e-b8cdf10183f1/screen568x568.jpeg" alt="Authentic Weather screenshot from iTunes"></a></p>

<p>Why do we need that? Why do we need to say, “It&#39;s f---ing cloudy now”? The point of the app, according to <a href="http://www.behance.net/gallery/Authentic-Weather-for-iOS/10324571">this gallery</a>, is to be authentic, honest, and get to the point. If you want to get to the point, leave out the superfluous words. Simply say “it’s cloudy”. You don&#39;t need the expletive “f---ing”. It’s unwarranted and crude. In addition, you don’t need the word “now” because of the present tense conjugation “it’s”.  If you want to “get to the point”, as the app’s proclamation states, “it’s raining” is more succinct.</p>

<p>Some might argue, “but the cursing adds personality”. The dictionary defines personality as “the combination of characteristics or qualities that form an individual’s distinct character”. So if you want to hang out with someone (or something, in this case an app) whose character is formed by an unrefined, debased lexicon full or superfluous crudities then by all means.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>As designers (and human beings) let’s ennoble people. Eliciting emotion through vulgarity is a lot easier than doing it through nobility (or at least decency). And that applies to everything be it design, humor, education, or anything else. </p>

<p>You want to be good? Elicit human emotion (like the book 50 Shades of Grey). You want to be great? Ennoble the human spirit and intellect (like the timeless book Les Miserables).</p>

        <h1 class="title"><a href="/jim-nielsen.com/blog/posts/kindlingapp-home-page-redesign">Home Page Redesign of kindlingapp.com</a></h1>
        
    </header>


    <!-- Article Content
    =================================== -->
    <div class="content">
        <p>I recently redesigned the <a href="http://kindlingapp.com">kindlingapp.com</a> home page. The old home page jumped right into talking about APIs and security features without ever describing what the software was actually for. In contrast, the new design strives to more clearly and succinctly articulate what Kindling is and what real-life problems it solves.</p>

<h2>Communicating Clearly</h2>

<p>There’s an article stating how <a href="http://qz.com/132070/the-simple-reason-products-fail-consumers-dont-understand-what-they-do/">the simple reason products fail is because consumers don’t understand what they do</a>. To create a new, successful product you have to be able to communicate to customers what it is your product does and how it can solve their problems.</p>

<p>Upon first impression that may sound easy, but it’s harder than you might think. Genuinely original and innovative products don’t fall into existing product categories. As a result, these innovations are often difficult to describe because there is no current framework for understanding them. Things that are difficult to describe will be even more difficult to understand, and that’s where the problem begins for businesses: when consumers don’t understand a product’s purpose they immediately lose interest.</p>

<p>One of the best places to communicate what your business is all about is your website. Communicating an entire product’s purpose on the homepage requires lots of focus and discipline. </p>

<p>The new disciplined design for <a href="http://kindlingapp.com">kindlingapp.com</a> focuses on narrating how Kindling is useful in discovering, sharing, and realizing ideas within an organization. My wife, after seeing the new page, said, &quot;oh, I actually know what the company you work for does now&quot;. </p>

<h2>The Design</h2>

<p>The design started with a collaborative Google doc for the page’s copy. Though not visual, creating and crafting the copy was one of the most difficult tasks of the design. After innumerable edits the copy provided enough substance to get started on devising visuals for the narrative. I started with various sketches to determine how and where the visuals could aid in communicating Kindling’s purpose.</p>

<p><img src="blog/assets/img/2013/kindling-home-sketch.jpg" alt="Kindling home page sketches"></p>

<p>The artwork was then created in Photoshop. I dribbled a few previews of the work for historical sake:</p>

<p><a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1233555-Narrative-and-artwork-concepts"><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44352/screenshots/1233555/home-artwork.png" alt="Narrative and artwork concepts"></a></p>

<p><a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1237949-People-graphic"><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44352/screenshots/1237949/people.png" alt="People Artwork"></a></p>

<p>After drawing up the graphics and reviewing them with stakeholders, it was time to turn the design elements into markup and responsively test the designs across devices:</p>

<p><a href="http://dribbble.com/shots/1242191-Testing-responsively-now"><img src="http://dribbble.s3.amazonaws.com/users/44352/screenshots/1242191/drib.jpg" alt="Testing responsively now"></a></p>

<h2>Final Product</h2>

<p><img src="blog/assets/img/2013/kindling-home-preview.jpg" alt="Kindling home page screenshot"></p>

<p>It seems rather simple but forming the narrative and accompanying graphics took a lot of work. It is difficult to take everything an entire company stands for and distill it into a page that’s clear and simple enough for an anyone to understand. </p>

<p>Iteration on the narrative will continue to take place, but this new home page was a great leap forward in explaining the problems Kindling’s software can solve.</p>
