        <p>I was trying to import a SQL database into a local copy of Wordpress. The SQL file was larger than the standard 2MB upload limit, so Wordpress wouldn&#39;t let me upload it. </p>

<p>After some research, I realized I could change the <code>max_upload_filesize</code> in the <code>php.ini</code> file. However, after changing the value to 10MB, Wordpress was still indicating the prior upload limit of 2MB. After wasting time trying other fixes, I suddenly realized I had not restarted apache!</p>

<p><img src="blog/assets/img/2013/duh.gif" alt="Duh!"></p>

<p>From the command line <code>sudo apachectl restart</code> restarted my local apache server and changed my upload limit to 10MB in Wordpress.</p>

<p><strong>Lesson</strong>: if you&#39;re tinkering in configuration files, don&#39;t forget to restart apache to see your changes!</p>

        <p>I recently redesigned my wordpress theme for <a href="http://iosicongallery.com">iOS Icon Gallery</a> and <a href="http://macicongallery.com">Mac Icon Gallery</a>. </p>

<p>The old themes provided the ability to comment through the interface. Due to a lack of real comments and a surplus in spam comments, I decided to entirely remove the ability to comment from the interface. </p>

<h2>Removing the Ability to Comment From the Interface Is Not Enough to Keep Out Spam</h2>

<p>Once my theme went live, I was still getting spam comments in the Wordpress backend. I asked myself, &quot;how are comments still appearing in the Wordpress backend when I don&#39;t have a single comment form on my website?&quot; After some Googling, I discovered this was due to spambots posting data directly using <code>wp-comments-post.php</code>. </p>

<p><img src="blog/assets/img/2013/sneaky.gif" alt="Sneaky Gif"></p>

<h2>Further Stopping Spambots</h2>

<p>To prevent spambots from posting to Wordpress via a URL, you can block access to <code>wp-comments-post.php</code> via the <code>.htaccess</code> file. Simply include these rules in your <code>.htaccess</code> file (thanks to <a href="http://www.catswhocode.com/blog/snippets/blockreduce-wordpress-spam-comments-via-htaccess">catswhocode</a>)</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;
    RewriteEngine On
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_METHOD} POST
    RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} .wp-comments-post.php*
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !.*yourdomainname.* [OR]
    RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^$
    RewriteRule (.*) ^http://%{REMOTE_ADDR}/$ [R=301,L]
&lt;/IfModule&gt;
</code></pre></div>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Be sure to change the <code>yourdomainname</code> part!</p>

<h2>That Doesn&#39;t Help You?</h2>

<p>If this doesn&#39;t seem like the best fix for you, try looking at this article from WP Tuts+ detailing <a href="http://wp.tutsplus.com/tutorials/security/6-easy-and-efficient-ways-to-combat-spam-comments/">easy and efficient ways to combat spam comments</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="http://www.youtube.com/embed/S80mE3kQTJ0">Here&#39;s a video</a> showcasing the potential of Google Glass.</p>

<p>All I could see in this video is Google Glass&#39; potential for frustration. My experience in paying for a coffee would most likely go something like this:</p>

<p><strong>Me</strong>: [<em>me paying for coffee, speaking to glass</em>] Ok glass, pay for coffee, use my credit card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Using debit card ending in 4516<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: No glass, I said <em>credit</em> card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Which credit card would you like to use?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: My American Express<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Which American Express would you like to use?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: My gold card<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Error. Sorry, you don&#39;t have a &quot;gold&quot; American Express card. Valid types are cards ending in: 4512 and 7483<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I don&#39;t know, use the card ending in 4512<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Processing … transaction cancelled. Trying again … it appears you don&#39;t have any money on this card. Trying American Express card ending in 7483 … processing<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: [<em>speaking to cashier</em>] Sorry, it will just take another second, my card isn&#39;t going through. I always have trouble with that card. American Express always stops transactions on it, I wonder if it&#39;s beca...<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Stopping transaction...<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: No Glass! I wasn&#39;t talking to you. Keep using that card.<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Transaction stopped. What would you like to do now?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Ok Glass, let&#39;s try this again. Pay for coffee.<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: You don&#39;t have any valid credit cards, but you can add a new one. What&#39;s the number?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: I don&#39;t&#39; want to say my credit card number out loud.<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Error. What do you want to do now?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Damnit glass. Ok pay for coffee. Use PayPal<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Password please?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Damnit I can&#39;t say my password here in front of everyone!<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Password please?<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: Ugh, damn you glass.<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: [<em>speaking to cashier</em>] I&#39;m sorry, I&#39;m going to have to just not get this coffee<br>
<strong>Me</strong>: [<em>walking out the door, speaking to glass</em>] How much does a used Google Glass go for on eBay?<br>
<strong>Glass</strong>: Searching Google for used glass gophers on eBay  </p>

    <!-- Article Content

    <div class="content">
        <p>When an idea strikes, what do you do with it? The commonly-held belief is that you sketch the idea on paper, as a sort of refinement process. Why? Because ideas, especially visual ones, are conceptually rough and difficult to articulate. Sketching an idea on paper can be a process of refinement. Through sketching, an idea becomes sufficiently polished to warrant actual implementation.</p>

<p>However, there is another purpose to sketching that is often overlooked. Sketching isn&#39;t always about slowly shaping and fine-tuning a single idea. In Smashing Magazine&#39;s recent publication <em><a href="http://www.the-mobile-book.com/">The Mobile Book</a></em>, Dennis Kardys writes a chapter called “Hands on Design for Mobile” in which he points out this disparate purpose to ideation and sketching:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We often think of sketching as a way to generate and communicate ideas, but it can also be a weapon to dismantle them. The goal of sketching ... isn’t to produce drawings that inform the final design ... The goal is to drive out those stubborn, thorny ideas and make room for new ones. Only then can we look anew and achieve a deeper understanding of what we’re designing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sometimes you work with ideas like a mason works with stone. You start with a large, unformed block of stone and slowly chip away at it until you arrive at the finished product. However, sometimes you work with ideas like a farmer doing a controlled burn. You burn everything down to make room for new growth. Only then do you see anew things hidden beforehand. </p>
