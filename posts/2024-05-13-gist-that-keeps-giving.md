# The Gist That Keeps On Giving

I’m working with git and make a big boo-boo.

Now I’m facing a situation where I’ve deleted a local branch with all my work and there’s no backup on GitHub.

“This is git. There has got to be a version of this things still on my computer _somewhere_, right? RIGHT?!”

So I start searching online: “how to recover a deleted branch in git?”

A few results later, [I find this gist](https://gist.github.com/umayr/b95e11d5f22c24a872ef95d215ba2ab1).

Not one to copy/paste CLI commands straight off the internet (_cough_ `rm -rf /` _cough_) I read through the script.

`git reflog`

Idk what that is, but yes, I should be flogging myself after what I just did.

What else is in here? 

`git checkout`

Yeah that seems fine. What else?

`git branch`

Ok, that’s not dangerous. 

Yeah I think I can give this a shot.

A few commands later and the work I thought was gone forever is restored to my computer. Hallelujah! 

Now, one of the principle rules of the internet is: “Don’t read the comments.” But that’s where I go because this gist just saved my life.

And apparently not just mine. Other folks are saying the same thing:

- “you saved my life”
- “Thank you so much, you saved me”
- “Still saving lives in 2023”
- “Still saving lives in 2024! Thank you so much!”

And not just lives. Saving asses too:

- “This post just saved my ass! Thank you”
- “You saved my ass as well!!!”
- “Another ass saved here.”

And time:

- “Thanks for this, it just saved me one month of work.”
- “saved me, i was gonna work all weekends.”
- “Thanks a lot! You saved me a week's worth of work!”
- “you have saved me a months worth of work”

One commenter even went so far as:

- “You deserve a Noble Peace Prize”

I love it!

Seeing as it saved my butt, [I also commented on the gist](https://gist.github.com/umayr/b95e11d5f22c24a872ef95d215ba2ab1?permalink_comment_id=4839742#gistcomment-4839742).

And because I commented, I’ve since been subscribed to further comments on the gist. And you know what? I kinda like it. I haven’t unsubscribed yet. It’s so fun. Every so often I get a new email notification from someone who commented on the gist, pouring out their gratitude.

Spread the love. As Jeremy says in [“Our Web”](https://adactio.com/journal/21098):
