# The Humble Link

I was joking on Mastodon about how the zeitgeist has changed over the years, but its pattern is revealing itself: an acronym which merely drops letters. The Next Big Thing™ is clearly going to be “A”.

- 2010: Everyone needs an "API"
- 2020: Everyone needs "AI"
- 2030: Everyone needs "A"

So I just need to figure out what “A” is and I’ll be rich!

> `<a>` the magic we already have

On snap. Mic drop right there.

It’s pretty wild that so many of the power struggles going on in tech stem from what is ultimately a fight over linking to something.

- The app store & steering provisions: you cannot `<a>` to an outside website
- AI: it won’t `<a>` to anything and cite its sources.
- Social media: you only get one `<a>` (“link in bio”)

That Tim-Berners Lee really threw a wrench in things when he made the humble `<a>` tag.

[Links are incredibly powerful](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2021/the-power-of-the-link/). The web’s reputation is often that it’s playing catch up. However, when it comes to links, that original invention is still transforming the world.
