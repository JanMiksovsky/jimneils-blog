# Personal Websites Are As Vulnerable As Us

I look at some people’s personal websites and think, “Stupendous! If I ever reach that zenith of personal web design, I will call it quits.”

Then I read a post by them later and they say something like, “Gah! I just really don’t like where I’m at with my personal website.”

And in my mind I say, “WHAAAAAATTTT??!?!?”

To me, they’re living the personal website dream! But they don’t feel that way. They seem to feel…well the same way I feel about my personal website.

It’s like our personal websites are a mirror to ourselves — a place where the mind’s eye must reconcile with the optical eye’s perception of reality.

It’s a torturous affair, to be sure.

And yet, people still publish those personal sites, those redesigns, those half-baked ideas.

There’s something vulnerable about publishing a personal website for the whole world to see, like standing up before a big crowd. 

And there’s no bigger crowd than the whole internet.
