# Christmas Day

It’s Christmas circa 2004.

My teenage brothers, sisters, and I have all finished opening presents and we’re more than content to have absolutely **nothing** to do — it’s Christmas day after all!

But not Dad. He’s in the bathroom laying tile.

Again, this is _Christmas day_ and Dad is on his hands and knees, in the bathroom, laying tile.

We all laugh at him. “Look at this guy, he can’t not do work on Christmas Day. He has a problem.”

Fast-forward two decades and, when our family gets together, we still get a good laugh poking fun at Dad — “Remember when he was laying tile in the bathroom on Christmas? Lol!”

And yet.

Here it is, Christmas day 2024. The kids are all asleep after a hectic day, and where do I find myself?

Working on my personal website.

I ask myself, “What am I doing? It’s the end of Christmas day and I’m working on my website? _I_ have a problem!”

But then I think of Dad on Christmas.

Maybe we’re more similar than I thought. 

What I saw as “work” I now see as finding solace in doing something he knew how to do well, even if others might laugh at him.

I used to laugh.

Now I think I just understand him better.
