# Bulletproof Method to Solving Problems

**Step 1**: Write down the problem in a message you plan to send to a co-worker.

Most of the time you’ll solve the problem before you’re done with Step 1. However, if you complete Step 1 and still have the problem, continue to Step 2.

**Step 2**: Hit the “Send” button.

Shortly after sending, the solution will present itself. I don’t know why this is. I don’t make the rules. But the solution frequently presents itself after you hit “Send” and no longer need the recipient’s help.

**Step 3**: Return to message you just sent and follow up with: [“Nevermind. Figured it out.”](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C40w-f3PA7I)

Ok, ok. This is in jest — a little bit. But it is a good method for getting yourself unstuck.
