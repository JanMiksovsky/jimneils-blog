# Hacker News Clones

Every once in a while, I’ll have a post gain traction over on ye ole’ orange site (Hacker News).

I find out about it because [my analytics digest](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/2022/netlify-analytics-email-digest/) will get a _yuge_ uptick in page views. 

What’s interesting is all the referral sources that show up in my analytics. _The_ Hacker News is always at the top, but then after it comes a bunch of clones or related “scraped tech news” sites.

I sometimes click through just to see them and marvel at what an interesting, diverse place the web is and all the people building on it.

Here’s a list of the ones that showed up in my analytics recently:

While I personally don’t spend a lot of time on Hacker News, I kinda love that the site exists, gets so much traffic, and AFAIK the owners aren’t actively seeking to make every last pageview happen on their domain (`news.ycombinator.com`).

I kinda love that there are still places on the web where people can explore creating alternative experiences without being shut down because they are outside the officially-sanctioned environment.
