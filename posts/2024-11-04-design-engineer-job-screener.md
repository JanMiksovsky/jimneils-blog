# Job Screening Blog Post

Take a look at these two animated gifs.

First:

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2024/job-screening-before.gif" width="672" height="192" alt="Animated gif of a button being clicked and the UI changing. The text heading in the UI is shifting upwards by 1px." />

Second:

<img src="https://cdn.jim-nielsen.com/blog/2024/job-screening-after.gif" width="672" height="192" alt="Animated gif of a button being clicked and the UI changing. The text heading in the UI doesnâ€™t shift at all." />

Can you tell the difference between them?

Do you care?

If not, we might not be a good fit.
