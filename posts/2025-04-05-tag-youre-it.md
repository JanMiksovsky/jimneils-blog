# Tag, You’re It

I saw these going around, but didn’t think I’d ever see myself get tagged — then [Eric assuaged my FOMO](https://ericwbailey.website/published/tag-youre-it/).

[As I’ve done elsewhere talking about how I blog](https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-jim-nielsen), I’m gonna try and impose a character limit to my answers (~240). I’m not sure if that makes my job as the writer easier or [harder](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/28/shorter-letter/), but it should make your job as the reader easier.

## Why did you start blogging in the first place?

I think I started because everything I learned about building on the web came from reading other people’s blogs online, so I wanted to be a “web person” like them.

## What platform are you using to manage your blog and why did you choose it?

At the time of this writing (April 2025):

- I write in [iA Writer](https://ia.net/writer).
- Code for my [blog](https://github.com/jimniels/blog) and [notes](https://github.com/jimniels/notes) is on GitHub.
- Deployment/hosting is via [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).

I’ve arrived at this setup less from a combination of choice and evolution. As me and my writing evolve, my process and tools evolve too.

## Have you blogged on other platforms before?

Blogspot, way back in the day. It’s no longer up, which is probably for the best. I was posting stuff I made from following “make this in Photoshop” tutorials.

Or I’d practice trying to visually express silly puns.

Or I’d make visual mashups of culture at the time.

## How do you write your posts? For example, in a local editing tool, or in a panel/dashboard that’s part of your blog?

For a detailed history of changes on how I blog, [I blog about blogging under #myBlog](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/#myBlog) and I [blog about microblogging under #myNotes](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/#myNotesSite). Read any of those posts for insights into my ever-changing process.

## When do you feel most inspired to write?

When I read other people’s thoughts.

## Do you publish immediately after writing, or do you let it simmer a bit as a draft?

I’m a simmerer. Rarely does a post go from thought to published in one sitting. For example, here’s a screenshot of my current simmering drafts (note my sophisticated editorial process of assigning each draft a letter prefix for sorting based on my appetite for finishing it).

## What are you generally interested in writing about?

Stuff I make.

Or stuff others make.

Or thoughts I think while reading thoughts others think.

I have a [tags page](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/) that tries to capture what I write categorically — for example, I blog [notes from books I read](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/#bookNotes), and [podcasts I listen to](https://blog.jim-nielsen.com/tags/#podcastNotes) — but TBH it’s not the greatest taxonomy of my writing.

Reductively: I blog about web design and development.

## Who are you writing for?

Whoa, that question got me more introspective than I expected. Gonna move on before this becomes an existential crisis.

## What’s your favorite post on your blog?

[I used to](https://github.com/jimniels/blog/blob/0573764d696ffaab74d6e47223d4b1f19980abfd/scripts/cache-site-data.js#L9-L20) highlight some of my favs on my home page,  but I stopped. Choosing favorites is hard. 

My blog posts are like my kids: I love them all equally, lol.

I suppose my favorite blog post is the one I’ll publish next.

## Any future plans for your blog? Maybe a redesign, a move to another platform, or adding a new feature?

_Will_ I redesign? Lol, the question is: _when_ will you redesign?

## Tag ‘em

Sorry if I mention someone who’s already been tagged:

- [Piper Haywood](https://piperhaywood.com) — Love Piper’s mix of the personal and professional. Still have bookmarked to try [grandma’s recipe](https://piperhaywood.com/grandma-pipers-ice-cream-cake-recipe/).
- [Tyler Gaw](https://tylergaw.com) — Have loved and respected this dude since I met him at my first “real” webdev job in NYC.
- [David Bushnell](https://dbushell.com) — Been enjoying David’s short- and long-form writing a lot as of late. Plus we  feel the same about Deno & HTTP modules. 
- [Katie Langerman](https://bsky.app/profile/katielangerman.bsky.social) - Ah gotcha, that’s not a blog link. It’s Bluesky. But I’ve followed Katie on the socials and always enjoy her perspective. Not sure she has a personal blog, so this is a vote of confidence in her starting one :) 
- [Jan Miksovsky](https://jan.miksovsky.com) — Jan is doing really cool stuff with [Web Origami](https://weborigami.org) (also just a super nice guy).

Sorry, I’m not gonna ping any of these folks. If they read my blog, they’ll see their names. Otherwise, dear reader, consider it a suggestion to go subscribe to their stuff.
