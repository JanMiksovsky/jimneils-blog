# I Don’t Like The Term “IC” Either

I really liked Robin’s piece, [“Stop calling yourself an IC”](https://robinrendle.com/notes/stop-calling-yourself-an-IC/). 

I still remember the way I felt the first time I heard that term. It was used in a way where its connotations conveyed a kind of laziness via lack of ambition. And I thought, “But wait, _I_ am an individual contributor — and I like it. Is something wrong with me?”

Learning this term and glimpsing how it was used by folks above my paygrade was a bit of a shock. But, with time, I began to realize that everyone seemed to use the term so nonchalantly, like it was the most natural, descriptive term in the world for labeling a certain class of people.

So, as with many things that rub me the wrong way, I mostly just went on with my life. Pick your battles, ya know?

But when Robin posted about his dislike for the term, I had to at least write this little post to say: I don’t like it either.

In fact, it reminded me of another term I once heard and found myself shocked to hear people use so nonchalantly: “the talent”. Have you heard this?

From what I understand, it’s a term used commonly in creative fields like music, film, etc., to refer to the people who _do_ the performing or creating.

For example, managing a series of concerts at a stadium with performances by the likes of Taylor Swift, Beyonce, or Rihanna? They’re all merely “the talent” that are performing at the stadium.

The term, I imagine, is meant to differentiate one class of  people (the “talented” individuals) from the other classes of people who surround and support them (e.g. managers, producers, agents, etc.).

The context in which I heard the term was a planning meeting, where its usage conveyed an idea along the lines of: “Whatever ‘the talent’ comes up with, we’ll take it, market it, and sell it.” (Talent and creativity being mere commodities, you see.)

I remember thinking the term seemed so flippant. How could they call them “the talent”, as if they were a mere auxiliary to the task at hand? “More like ‘the backbone’ or ‘the heart and soul’ or ‘the driving force’ of everything you’re doing,” I thought.

Anyhow, that’s all a long way of saying: I agree with Robin, I don’t like the term either and I won’t be calling myself one.
