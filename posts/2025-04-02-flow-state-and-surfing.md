# Flow State and Surfing

[Jack Johnson is on Rick Rubin’s podcast Tetragrammaton](https://www.tetragrammaton.com/content/jack-johnson-podcast) talking about music, film making, creativity, and surfing.

At one point (~24:30) Johnson talks about his love for surfing and the beautiful flow state it puts him in:

> Sometimes I’ll see a friend riding a wave while I’m paddling out, and the thing I’ll see them do just seems like magic...I’ll think, “How in the world did they just do that?” And then on your next ride you’re doing the exact same thing without thinking but it’s all muscle memory and it’s all in this flow that you get into. That’s a really beautiful state to get into, to do something that feels like a magic trick, like something you shouldn’t be able to do, but all of the sudden you’re doing it.

I’m not a surfer, and I can’t do effortlessly cool. But I know what a flow state feels like.

Johnson’s description reminds me of that feeling when you get a little time on a personal project — riding the wave of working on your personal website.

You open your laptop. You start paddling out. Maybe you see an internet friend who was doing something cool and you want to try it but you have no idea if you’ll be able to do it as well as they did.

And before you know it, you’re in that flow state where muscle memory takes over and you’re doing stuff without even consciously thinking about it — stuff that others might look at and perceive as magic (_cough_ anything on the command line _cough_) but it’s not magic to you. Intuition and experience just take over while you ride the wave.

Ok, I’m a nerd. But I don’t care. It’s a great feeling, regardless of whether it’s playing an instrument, or surfing, or programming. That feeling of sinking into a craft you’ve worked at your whole life that you don’t have to think about anymore.
