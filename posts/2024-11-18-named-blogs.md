# Named Blogs

I think it’s endearing when people name their blog.

I’m not talking about branding, like people do with professional blogs or newsletters.

I’m talking about personal blogs that people name out of care and idiosyncrasy.

It’s endearing, because you brand things you own, you name things you cherish.

We didn’t brand our family cat. And we don’t call him “The Nielsen’s cat” (though that’s probably what our neighbors call him). We named him. We call him “Fluffy”.

Don’t get me wrong, I like how personal it is when a personal blog is just someone’s name (that’s what mine is).

But I also love when folks add a little name or subtitle to communicate their personal feelings about their blog, e.g. “Little nothings: the blog of so-and-so”.

Here’s a few examples out in the wild of people I follow:

- Una Kravets’ blog: [“Almost Profound”](https://una.github.io)
- Thomas Steiner’s blog: [“blogccasion”](https://blog.tomayac.com)
- Maciej Cegłowski’s blog: [“Idle Words”](https://idlewords.com) (with the subtitle “brevity is for the weak”)

My sister had a blog for a long time — though sadly not anymore [insert comment here from old man yelling at cloud about the demise of blogging in the wider public].

I can’t remember the name of her blog, but the subtitle was “tasting life twice; in the moment and in retrospection” which was [a nod to Anaïs Nin](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/2787-we-write-to-taste-life-twice-in-the-moment-and). I think about that quote probably once a year — I love stuff like that!

Yeah, I know, I’m one to talk. My blog is titled “Jim Nielsen’s Blog” which, hey, at least it’s clear. Maybe I’d name it if I could land on a name I like, but I’m a fickle namer so don’t hold your breath. Perhaps I could start with a subtitle first, something like:

- “Jim’s Blog: Dialogues With Myself”
- “Jim’s Blog: A Refinery For Coarse Feelings”
- “Jim’s Blog: Opinions With a Shelf Life”

Oooof. Maybe I better leave this art to others.

You have a blog you follow whose name you love? Let me know — or even better, blog about it!
