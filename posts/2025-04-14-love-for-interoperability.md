# Some Love For Interoperable Apps

I like to try different apps.

What makes trying different apps incredible is a layer of interoperability — standardized protocols, data formats, etc.

When I can bring _my data_ from one app to another, that’s cool. **Cool apps are interoperable.** They work with my data, rather than own it.

For example, the other day I was itching to try  a new RSS reader. I’ve used [Reeder (Classic)](https://reederapp.com/classic/) for ages. But every once in a while I like to try something different.

This is super easy because lots of clients support syncing to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). It’s worth pointing out: Feedbin has their own app. But they don’t force you to use it. You’re free to use any RSS client you want that supports their service.

So all I have to do is download a new RSS client, login to Feedbin, and boom! An experience of _my data_ in a totally different app from a totally different developer.

That’s amazing!

And you know how long it took? Seconds. No data export. No account migration.

Doing stuff with my blog is similar. If I want to try a different authoring experience, all my posts are just plain-text markdown files on disk. Any app that can operate on plain-text files is a potential new app to try.

No shade on them, but this why I personally don’t use apps like [Bear](https://bear.app). Don’t get me wrong, I love so much about Bear. But it wants to keep your data in its own own proprietary, note-keeping safe. You can’t just open your notes in Bear in another app. Importing is required. But there’s a big difference between apps that import (i.e. copy) your existing data and ones that interoperably work with it. 

Email can also be this way. I use Gmail, which supports IMAP, so I can open my mail in lots of different clients — and believe me, I've tried _a lot_ of email clients over the years.

- Sparrow
- Mailbox
- Spark
- Outlook
- Gmail (desktop web, mobile app)
- Apple Mail
- Airmail

This is why I don’t use un-standardized email features because I know I can’t take them with me.

It’s also why I haven’t tried email providers like HEY! Because they don't support open protocols so I can’t swap clients when I want.

My email is a dataset, and I want to be able to access it with any existing or future client. I don't want to be stuck with the same application for interfacing with my data forever (and have it tied to a company).

I love this way of digital life, where you can easily explore different experiences of your data. I wish it was relevant to other areas of my digital life. I wish I could:

- Download a different app to view/experience my photos
- Download a different app to view/experience my music 
- Download a different app to view/read my digital books

In a world like this, applications would compete on an experience of my data, rather than on owning it. 

The world’s a big place. The entire world doesn’t need one singular photo experience to Rule Them All.

Let’s have experiences that are as unique and varied as us.
