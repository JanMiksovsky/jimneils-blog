# Randomness, Serendipity, and an “I Wouldn’t Recommend This” Algorithm

Sean Voisen has [a great post](https://sean.voisen.org/marginalia/in-praise-of-randomness-james-bridle) about 1) how we as humans think of randomness, 2) how computers simulate randomness, and the difference between the two. 

He puts forth an intriguing thought: in a world increasingly driven by computation, how does that affect randomness in our lives? Here’s Sean:

> We could all benefit from more randomness in our lives more than we may realize. By veering off the beaten path, by being exposed to new things we would otherwise never expose ourselves to, we increase the possibilities for serendipitous and creative encounters. But our increasingly computationally-dependent world is fundamentally incompatible with allowing this to happen.

Be exposed to things we would otherwise never be exposed to? That sounds like the antithesis of the algorithm.

The algorithm is: “You liked that? I bet you would like this!”

But where is an algorithm that says: “You liked that? I bet you would never choose this — but here it is anyway!”

I have to admit, I have a number of things in my life where I could say, “I would have never chosen ____, but it’s been one of the best things in my life!” Many things I would’ve never chosen, yet they came to me, and they’ve changed my perspective and outlook and my life. 

Where’s that algorithm?

I suppose it’s hard to make money off of, “Here’s some stuff you would never choose for yourself.”

So, where possible, I like the suggestion to make room for randomness in your life — and that might just mean stepping away from the pseudo-randomness of the computer more often.
