This project all started with an idea: how about a rubber stamp of Kindling’s brand that could be used (amongst other things) in composing personlized correspondence from Kindling? I put the idea into [Kindling](http://kindlingapp.com) to see if it would take hold.

After getting buy-in from co-workers, the idea was approved. Now it was up to me to bring it to fruition.

I already knew who I wanted to produce the stamp: [Casey Rubber Stamps](http://www.caseyrubberstamps.com/) in the East Village. Using their website, I ascertained the size specifications for personalized stamps and decided we would want either the one or two square inch cuts.

Next I started thinking about the stamp’s design. Usually I begin by sketching ideas, but I envisioned this stamp as a simple, straightforward take on the Kindling glyph so I skipped sketching and jumped right into Illustrator where I played around with a variety of design possibilities but ultimately discovered that simplest was best.

In order to decide which size would be best, I did a low-fidelty print of these variations to see which size appeared best (it’s much easier to judge a tangible product’s sizing when you view tangible prototypes as opposed to something on screen). I realized two square inches was way to big, so I went with the one square inch.

Aesthetically, I really liked the flame that is offset in the circle. However, it didn’t really make sense to do that with Kindling’s brand mark because it doesn’t have universal ubiquity. So instead I boiled down my choices to the encircled flame, either inversed or not. From there, I chose the inversed version because I wanted to see more ink on paper rather than less.

I exported the file and sent it off to Casey’s for production. After a few days they emailed me and said it was ready for pick up. In the store, I chose two on-brand ink colors for stamping: blank and orange. Now I only needed to get some paper.

I went over to a paper store off 5th Ave. and browsed their paper offerings until I found just what I wanted. The paper was a thicker weight with a slight texture on it which produced a feeling of quality and care in hand.

I got all these supplies back to the office and started stamping! I really liked the end result. The Micron pens we used for writing letters helped contribute to the quality feel of the final product.
