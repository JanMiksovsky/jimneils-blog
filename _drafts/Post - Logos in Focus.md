Title: Famous Logos in Focus

> How far out of focus can an image be and still be recognized? A [logo] which is subject to an infinite number of uses, abuses, and variations whether for competitive purposes or for reasons of “self-expression,” cannot survive unless it is designed with utmost simplicity and restraint—keeping in mind that seldom is a trademark favored with more than a glance. Simplicity implies not only an aesthetic ideal, but a meaningful idea, either of content or form, that can be easily recalled (Paul Rand, *A Designers Art* 31).

This is an interesting idea. First of all, in a world before 100% pure digital reproducibility, the test of a logo would be to see how well it could endure visual entropy in the real world. For example, how well could a logo on letterhead maintain its visual integrity and recognizability after being faxed multiple times? Every time a letterhead with a logo gets faxed it's going to lose its visual integrity to a point of being illegible. 

However, digital technology lends itself to 100% pure reproducibility. Because digital files are an exact copy of their original, they do not lose any visual integrity and are dependent solely on the visual integrity of the original file.

To explore this theory, I wanted to test rather ubiquitous brand logos and see how well their forms stood up when brought out of focus. At what point would they become unrecognizable? Which logos could go the furthest out of focus while still retaining their visual integrity and recognizability?

In the digital world, where copies are a pure, 1:1 match of the original, you don't have to worry about this as much. Sure, things like 72ppi or 144ppi may cause slight blue issues, but those have more to do with sharpening an image than avoiding the un-recognizability of it. 

## The Test

Spurred by Paul Rand's question, "How far out of focus can an image be and still be recognized?", I put a variety of rather ubiquitos brand logos to a test of blurriness. 

Each logo was subjected to an increasing scale of gaussian pixels blurs. Each logo was subjected to what is an equivalent of 40, 30, 20, and 10 pixel gaussian blurs in Photoshop.

Additionally, I wanted to remove color from each logo because it can be a vital ingredient in recognizing a brand. For example, perhaps all you see is a blur, but if that blur is the color magenta you might more easily guess “T-Mobile” as opposed to some other brand. Boiling all the logos down to their essence — their shapes and forms in single color — helps establish and verify how well the mark can stand on its own.

Here are a few examples of how well some of the logos fared:

#### Nike

Nike's iconic mark fared the best. As you can see, between the 20 and 30 pixel blur marks the logo really starts to lose it’s integrity. By 40 pixels the symbol is almost unrecognizable. However, due to it's horizontal elongation and scaling visual weight from left to right, it held up rather well to serious pixel blurs as opposed to other more symmetrical logos.

## Apple

As you can see...

## Conclusion

Part of how easily you recognize the mark not only has to do with its design, but also its ubiquity. The more recognizable a mark is, the more you’ve been exposed to it, the more easily you’ll recognize it. For example, you might see one mark that is significantly out of focus and guess it is "McDonalds" rather than "Dodge Ram" because you've been exposed to the Mcdonalds mark more and thus make that connection. Repetitious exposure to a brand's mark leads to higher recognition. Thus, it can be inferred that the efficacy of a brand mark is often less dependent on its design than on its consistent, repetitious exposure to the public eye.

Some might think this means there is no substance to logo design. That one need only create a logo, any logo, and then just expose it as much as possible to the public view. This assumption, however, is false. Certain shapes and forms lend themselves to be more easily remembered. Additionally, shapes, forms, and colors all have inherent societal meanings which cannot be overlooked when designing a logo. For example, if you were in the funeral business, you wouldn't want to use a logo that looks like the skull and cross bones, no matter how much exposure you give it.
