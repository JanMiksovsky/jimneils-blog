Title: Famous Logos in Focus

I was reading Paul Rand’s *A Designers Art* and stumbled across this quote:

> How far out of focus can an image be and still be recognized? A [logo] which is subject to an infinite number of uses, abuses, and variations whether for competitive purposes or for reasons of “self-expression,” cannot survive unless it is designed with utmost simplicity and restraint—keeping in mind that seldom is a trademark favored with more than a glance. Simplicity implies not only an aesthetic ideal, but a meaningful idea, either of content or form, that can be easily recalled (Paul Rand, *A Designers Art* 31).

I found this a rather intriguing concept. Prior to our current world of 100% pure digital reproducibility, one test of a logo was to see how well it could endure visual entropy in real world use. For example, how well could a logo on letterhead maintain its visual integrity and recognizability after being faxed multiple times? Each time a letter was faxed it slightly lost its visual integrity to the point of becoming unrecognizable or unreadable. Thus, a well-designed logo would maintain it’s readability and recognizability through the stages of visual entropy that result from real-world use.

In contrast, today’s digital technology ensures 100% exact reproducibility. Because digital files are a 1:1 mirrored copy of their original, they do not lose any visual integrity and are dependent solely on the integrity of the original file. Due to this, many designers today might not fret over a logo’s resistance to visual entropy. Sure, things like higher pixel density in 72ppi or 144ppi screens may cause slight blur issues when displaying a logo, but those issues have more to do with sharpening an image than avoiding the its complete demise into  unrecognizability. 

I decided to try a simple experiment: take some of today’s most iconic, ubiquitous logos and see how well they hold to being distorted.

## Experiment Details

I decided I would test each logo’s visual stamina by bringing each one out of focus incrementally with a gaussian blur. At what point would each logo become unrecognizable? Would some of them lose their integrity after a small 5 pixel blur? What about a 10 pixel blur? Which iconic brand logos could go the furthest out of focus while still retaining their visual integrity and recognizability?

Additionally, I wanted to remove color from each logo because it can be a vital ingredient in brand recognition. For example, perhaps all you see is a blur, but if that blur is the color magenta you might more easily guess “T-Mobile” as opposed to some other brand. Boiling all the logos down to their essence — their shapes and forms in single color — helps establish and verify how well the mark can stand on its own.

Here are a few examples of how well some of the logos fared:

So how did they fare?

### The Worst

Logos which shared the same visual form fared the worst. For example, circular logos like ABC, General Electric, and PBS all consist primarily of a circle with a distinctive mark cut out of it. When heavily blurred, these logos begin to all look alike and become indistinguishable from each other.

This is not to say that circular logos are necessarily bad. However, upon being brought out of focus they do lose their visual distinctness and, thus, recognizability.

### The Best

The logos of Nike and Puma seemed to fare the best. As you can see, towards the blurriest end of the spectrum the logos seem *almost* unrecognizable.

![Puma Logo blurred](http://jim-nielsen.com/logos/assets/images/build/logos/jpgs/puma.jpg "Puma Logo")

However, these two marks remain somewhat recognizable due to their distinctive forms which retain at least some degree of visual integrity (as opposed to other more symmetrical logo designs which start all look the same when heavily blurred). 

Nike, for example, holds up rather well when heavily blurred due to it’s horizontal elongation and scaling visual weight from left to right. Similarly, the perpendicularity of the tail on Puma’s mark helps to retain its visual form and discernability.

## Conclusions: What I Learned

Part of how easily you recognize a logo not only has to do with its design, but also its ubiquity. The more recognizable a mark is and the more you’ve been exposed to it often dictates how easily you’ll recognize it. For example, you might see one mark that is significantly out of focus and guess it is as "McDonalds" rather than "Dodge Ram" because you've been exposed to the McDonalds mark more and thus make that connection. Repetitious exposure to a brand’s mark leads to higher recognition. Thus, it can be inferred that the efficacy of a brand’s mark is often less dependent on its design than on its consistent, repetitious exposure to the public eye.

Some might think this means there is no substance to logo design, that one need only create a logo, any logo, and then just expose it as much as possible to the public view. This assumption, however, is false. Certain shapes and forms lend themselves to be more easily remembered. Additionally, shapes, forms, and colors all have inherent societal meanings which cannot be overlooked when designing a logo. For example, if you were in the funeral business, you wouldn't want to use a logo that looks like the skull and cross bones, no matter how much exposure you give it. 

Lastly, this specific test of a logo’s recognizability when out of focus has shown that a logo’s form can go a long way in strengthening its recognizability. Circular forms are very common and when heavily blurred tend to all look the same with no unique visual identifier. More abstract shapes however, like Nike and Puma, tend to retain their recognizability due to unique and stark contrasts in form which lead to easier recognizability.
