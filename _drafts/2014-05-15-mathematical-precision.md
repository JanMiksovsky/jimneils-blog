Overshoot is the amount by which a round letter needs to exceed the height or depth of a flat letter of the “same” size in order to look the same. In a well-crafted font, you’ll see that the O generally exceeds the cap height and baseline of an H by about 1–2%. This allows it to appear to be the same size—if it was drawn mathematically correctly, it would look too small. Pointy elements like the sharp apex of an A only look like they are the right height when they are about 3% taller. Even squares don’t need to really be square, by the way. A square looks square when it is about 1% taller than it is wide! The same is true of circles. — [Thomas Phinney](http://www.commarts.com/columns/know-font-sucks)

Talk about how mathematical precision can only get you so far. Flexible, fluid, mathematically-precise grids can be wonderful but if you aren’t breaking the grid you’re losing one of its most powerful assets.

Math can serve as a solid foundation for design, but allowing it to overtake the structure will always repress the potetial of any work. For example, pure math will left-align text with exact precision. But the human eye prefers the optical alignment of hanging punctuation.

> Punctuation marks in text only take up a small amount of cap height. Ordinarily this isn’t a problem, but when the punctuation mark is the first character on the straight edge of a body of text it leaves an abnormal amount of vertical spacing which can disrupt the visual flow of a body of text. — [Me on Hanging Punctuation over at Webdesigntuts](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/getting-the-hang-of-hanging-punctuation--cms-19890)


Pure math, and by extension data and statistics, can only get you so far. I know they say, “the numbers don’t lie,” and that’s probably true. But they also don’t tell the whole story. Intuition informed by trained optical judgement is what makes good designers great. They use intuition to make decisions based on the nuances of humans. When it comes to design, pure faith in mathematical decision making leaves no room for the designer. It exalts math, rules, operations, and computation as the ultimate source of authority. “We’d love to make the button blue, but the numbers don’t lie." [A dystopia where computers make my decisions](http://jackilby.files.wordpress.com/2013/12/wall-e-humans.jpg) is a world I’d rather avoid.
