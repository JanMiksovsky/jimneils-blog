Goals of the site (describe results under each point):
    - Use a templating language, not php (used handlebars)
    - Get a front end task runner (get linting for js and data files)
    - Tried Grunt
    - Tried Gulp
    - More official colors (HEX, RGB, CMYK, PMS) talk about how did this ... rgb hex conversion, noralize json, etc
    - Separate each league into it's own sketch file for svgs

Results:

## colors and ata
Rather than one big .json file with every league and every team, each league now has its own corresponding .json file with each team's data in it. So in `src/data` I have `nba.json`, `mlb.json`, `nfl.json`, etc. with each file having an array of objects, each object corresponding to a team.
