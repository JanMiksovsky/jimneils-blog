[In an eariler post this year](http://jim-nielsen.com/blog/2015/everything-but-visual-design/), I wrote about our plan to redo the marketing site at Kindling. In the post, I described our efforts in defining the “redesign” of the site and how it all began with sketches, wireframes, and meetings. It was everything but the visual design.

After sweat and tears, we’ve now shipped our brand-new, shiny site at [kindlingapp.com](http://kindlingapp.com). In this post, I want to give a brief, visual overview of my process towards brining M2 (as I will be calling it) to life.

## Information Architecture (IA)

Before talking about what the site might look like, we had to first determine how it would function. This part of the process required we ask questions like these:

- How does each individual page relate to all the others as a whole?
- What is the information architecture of the site as whole?
- What URL structure would most effectively mirror the IA?
- What sections of the site require a consistent, inter-weaving narrative and flow amongst pages?

We went through various iterations before finally arriving at a specific architecture and flow. For the “Tour” part of the site, a colleague created a flowchart which served as a conversation piece for communicating purpose and design direction towards stakeholders.

Additionally, we created an IA diagram specifying each page of the site with its corresponding URL and `<title>` tag. This helped provide a bird’s eye view of the site and get a sense of scope and page relationship.

## Wireframes

Once we had a good sense of the scope of the site and it’s IA, the flowchart and diagram served as the foundations for the rough wireframes I created around content. These helped convey flow and a sense of architecture to stakeholders, as sometimes simple IA diagrams and flowcharts aren’t enough for non-design or non-software people. They need more concrete visuals to get a real sense of the design direction.

These wireframes were constantly in flux as we would create them, talk about them internally as a design team, and iterate.

After internal iteration and discussions as a design team, we would move the conversation to a larger group of stakeholders to get buy-in on overall direction. If things needed to be tweaked, we went back to iterating on these flows until we got them all right.

## Sketches

It should be noted that all along this journey there were paper sketches — lots of sketches. Sketches of everything from IA to flow to page structure to page patterns to you name it. Oh, and along with these sketches were notes, insights, feedback, and much more.

I want to reinforce the number of sketches I produced. For me, pencil and paper is a great way to quickly prototype ideas and come up with good solutions in rough form, which I can then refine. Perhaps even more importantly, pencil and paper is the best tool I’ve found for burning through all the bad ideas in my mind. I can quickly iterate with litle friction. That’s why there are so many sketches around M2. Here are a few:

## Patterns and Mocks

One of the design elements I tried to develop most during the sketch and wireframe stage on through the production of high-fidelity mocks was page and information patterns. I asked myself, “self: how can I represent navigation, content, and other design elements in a consistent, unified manner?” Developing a card pattern quickly showed itself to be an advantageous solution. As I iterated through various versions of page patterns, I tweaked and adjusted typography, color, and shape patterns to create something that felt unified and coherent.

For example, here's a shot of the page patterns mock I worked on in two versions:

![M2 page patterns V1]({{ site.imageurl }}/2015/m2-page-patterns-1.png "Finding page patterns V1")

![M2 page patterns V2]({{ site.imageurl }}/2015/m2-page-patterns-2.png "Finding page patterns V2")

As you can see, in the second iteration we moved towards a stronger brand representation with colors representing different hierarchical parts of the site.
