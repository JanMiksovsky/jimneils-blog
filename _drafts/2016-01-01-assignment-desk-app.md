I had to build an app...

- Starting point
  - axure mocks (picutres of that)
  - Flow chart
  - Bootstrap framework, 'Application' theme
- Architecting (url schema, getting dev on board)
- Sketching frames, unifying views/patterns, implemented views as react components (iterated as we went)
  - List views
  - Item views
  - Error views
  - Create view
  - "outside app" login, etc
