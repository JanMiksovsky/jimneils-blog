title: "Words Have Meaning: Creating the “Let’s Talk Innovation” Page"
date: 2014-10-23
tags: design-process
summary: "An innocent mistake in naming at the beginning of a project created distorted conclusions in design thinking and led us down a road of confusion. We had to go back and think about the words we used to talk about things in order to proceed forward."

As part of an effort to bring relevant video content to exisiting and potential customers, we produced and edited a set of video conversations on innovation. When the idea was born, we called it “Kindling Academy Live” because, well, we needed a name for it and the employee in the videos was head of Kindling Academy. So that name seemed sufficient. 

Once the videos were in post-production and we began to think about where they would live on our marketing site, we ran into some architechtural issues. Because we were referring to these videos as “Kindling Academy Live” we simply assumed they would live within the top-tier section of our website called “Kindling Academy”. But in the actual implementation phase, we realized it wasn’t quite that simple. The more we talked, the more we realized this new content wouldn’t fit into the Kindling Academy architecture at all. Our innocent naming choice had not been innocuous. It held subtle and misleading connotations which had led us down a road of wrong assumptions where we kept trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. After discovering this problem in naming, we assigned this content a new working name: “Let’s Talk Innovation” and assigned it a top-tier spot on the website.

A new name and a new top-tier spot meant we needed a new page design. This fell to me. First I determined what content modules would make up the page and what their respective elements would be: 

- Video modules (only one to begin with), each consisting of:
    - Video embedd & thumbnail
    - Short description which would be sourced from a Wordpress rich text editor
    - “Featuring” module which would profile the people in each video
- “Coming soon” module consisting of:
    - Title & subtitle which would explain that, although there was only one video on the page in the beginning, a lot of new content would soon be coming
    - Form which would capture the email of anyone who wanted to be notified when new content would be released

Based on this content, I sketched a few initial ideas within the framework of the exisiting marketing site.

From there I jumped into Sketch to layout the design of the content modules. Things came together rather quickly
