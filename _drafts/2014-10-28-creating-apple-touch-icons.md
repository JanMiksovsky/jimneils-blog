With Yosemite and iOS8 having just been released, I decided it was time to update the [`apple-touch-icon`](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/SafariWebContent/ConfiguringWebApplications/ConfiguringWebApplications.html) for the Kindling web app. FYI: these icons are now being used not just on the springboard for iOS devices, but also as bookmarklet icons for Safari on iOS *and* Mac.

For this task I jumped right into Illustrator and started drawing. Before too long I had just what I wanted: a solid color with the Kindling glyph. I played around with the sizing a little bit and then I sat back and thought, “that was easy”.

But then I started to feel a little uneasy about the graphic I produced. It didn’t quite feel right. I realized I needed to introduce some subtlety to the icon to make it feel a little more natural. So I started playing with some variations:

In the end, I made a subtle background gradient using the main brand color `#ff8800`. That introduce a little more warmth to the icon as well. Then I used a subtle gradient on the flame as well. I realized that going from a light gray to pure white made the icon a little more friendly and easy on the eyes. It’s worth noting that the “gray” I used wasn't really pure gray. It had a hint of orange in it (just like the brand color). This made the icon a feel more natural as the gradients used tones of the surrounding artwork rather than pure black and white, which felt more unnatural.
