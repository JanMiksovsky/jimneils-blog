## Version 1

Way back in 2012, when I was working with the folks at Arc90, I had an idea. Remember that 2012 was when skeuomorphic design was king. So there were lots of buttons being designed that looked like this:

![skeuomorphic button](sassme-v2-skeuomorphic-button.png "Button design from [Pete Orme’s article](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/principles-for-successful-button-design--webdesign-6094)")

Creating buttons like that wasn’t always easy. Sure the button looks orange, but there are a lot of tiny color variations in there which provide the 3D effect. There was orange, but then there was slightly lighter orange, and slightly darker orange, and slightly warmer orange, and slightly cooler orange, and the list goes on.

![skeuomorphic button with colors](sassme-v2-skeuomorphic-button-colors.png "A single button skeuomorphic contained countless colors")

So, for a single button design, you might end up with CSS that looked like this:

```css
.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #FD892C 0%, #F4771A 50%, #EC6409 100%);
  border: 1px solid #CB5404;
  border-bottom-color: #B34A04;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #FD9B4B,
              0 3px 0 #CB5404;
}
```

See what we’ve got there? We have an orange gradient with three different colors, then a lighter orange inset, then a darker orange border and bottom box shadow along with an even darker bottom border. We have six different colors for that once button. In implementation, that started to get rather hairy.

Now, I had been working a lot with Sass back then (which was relatively new to me at the time) and was discovering all the neat functionality it provided around using colors in your stylesheets, like the [Sass color functions](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html). These proved incredibly handy. With a single color (usually your brand color) you could produce countless variations to produce a desired effect, whether it be a shadow, a border, a warmer tone, etc. Sass allowed me to write my CSS like this:

```sass
$brandColor: #F4771A;

.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, lighten($brandColor, 3%) 0%, $brandColor 50%, darken($brandColor, 3%) 100%);
  border: 1px solid saturate(darken($brandColor, 8%), 1%);
  border-bottom-color: saturate(darken($brandColor, 10%), 2%);
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px saturate(lighten($brandColor, 8%), 1%),
              0 3px 0 saturate(darken($brandColor, 8%), 1%);
}
```

The tricky part as a designer/developer was: when I want a slightly darker color, how do I know exactly how much I want to darken it? Will darkening it wipe out the saturation too much? How do I get the precise color I want? That’s where my idea came from. Why not build a tool that allows you to input a color, tweak the Sass color functions, and visually compare the output with the input until you get the variation you want?

The folks at Arc90 decided it was a problem worth trying to solve, so I mocked up some wireframes around what the interface for this tool would look like and they provided me some resources to help turn this thing into a reality. With some big help from friends at Arc (Matt, Robert, Jesse, and especially Darren Newton, the front-end wizard who helped translate the color functions of Sass (written in Ruby) to Javascript) we had just the tool we wanted.

Arc90 released the tool to the world and quite a few folks [quite a few folks found it rather useful](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=sassme.arc90.com):

![Screenshot of tweets](sassme-v2-screenshot-of-tweets.png)

The project lived in the wild for a few years at `http://sassme.arc90.com` (code was available on Github at [arc90/sass-color-picker](https://github.com/arc90/sass-color-picker)).

Then, one day, I got a tweet from someone asking me if the site was still around. I visited `http://sassme.arc90.com` and found the URL was dead. After reaching out to a few contacts, I found out that the parent company who had acquired Arc90 had gone bankrupt and stopped paying their web hosting fees. As a result, all `arc90.com` related domains had died. Seeing as people still found the tool useful, I resolved to take over the app myself and host it under my domain.

## Version 2.0

I copied the code from Arc90’s repository and immediately put it up under my domain at [http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme](http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme). Shortly thereafter I began rewriting the code to leverage React instead of jQuery. I was able to use a lot of the original math Darren had written for transforming colors, with just a few fine-tuned adjustments here and there to get the colors right (hex color output had been off by a value or two, as mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/arc90/sass-color-picker/issues/5)) which I was able to resolve.

The whole page got a bit of fresh paint from the design side and within a few weeks I pushed out version 2.0 of SassMe to [http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme](http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme).

You can find [SassMe’s code on Github](https://github.com/jimniels/sassme). Feel free to tweak, adjust, PR, file an issue, whatever. The tool is yours.
