## Version 1

Back in 2012, when I was working with the folks at Arc90, I had an idea. Let me remind you that in 2012, skeuomorphic design was king. So lots of UI buttons looked like this (button design from [an article by Pete Orme](https://webdesign.tutsplus.com/articles/principles-for-successful-button-design--webdesign-6094)):

![skeuomorphic button]({{ site.imageurl }}/2016/sassme-v2-skeuomorphic-button.png "Example button aesthetic circa 2012")

Creating buttons like that wasn’t always easy. Sure the button looks orange, but there are a lot of tiny color variations in there which provide the skeuomorphic effect. There was orange, but then there was a slightly lighter orange, and a slightly darker orange, and a slightly warmer orange, and a slightly cooler orange, and the list goes on.

![skeuomorphic button with colors]({{ site.imageurl }}/2016/sassme-v2-skeuomorphic-button-colors.png "A single button skeuomorphic contained countless colors")

So, for a single button design similar to the above, you might end up with CSS that looked like this:

```css
.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, #FD892C 0%, #F4771A 50%, #EC6409 100%);
  border: 1px solid #CB5404;
  border-bottom-color: #B34A04;
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px #FD9B4B inset,
              0 3px 0 #CB5404;
}
```

See what we’ve got there? We have six different colors for that one button. It can get tricky keeping track of and maintaining consistency for all those different colors.

## Enter My Idea

Now, I had been working a lot with Sass back then and was discovering all the neat functionality it provided around using colors in your stylesheets, like the [Sass color functions](http://sass-lang.com/documentation/Sass/Script/Functions.html). These proved incredibly handy. With a single color (usually your brand color) you could produce countless color variations to produce a desired effect, whether it be a shadow, a border, a warmer tone, etc. Sass allowed me to write my CSS like this:

```sass
$brandColor: #F4771A;

.button {
  background: linear-gradient(to bottom, lighten($brandColor, 3%) 0%, $brandColor 50%, darken($brandColor, 3%) 100%);
  border: 1px solid saturate(darken($brandColor, 8%), 1%);
  border-bottom-color: saturate(darken($brandColor, 10%), 2%);
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px saturate(lighten($brandColor, 8%), 1%),
              0 3px 0 saturate(darken($brandColor, 8%), 1%);
}
```

The tricky part as a designer/developer was: when I want a slightly darker color, how do I know exactly how much I want to darken it? Will darkening it wipe out the saturation too much? How do I get the precise color I want? That’s where my idea came from. Why not build a tool that allows you to input a color, tweak the Sass color functions, and visually compare the output with the input until you get the variation you want?

The folks at Arc90 decided it was a problem worth trying to solve, so I mocked up some wireframes around what the interface for this tool would look like and they provided me some resources to help turn this thing into a reality. Matt, Robert, and Jesse all helped. And [Darren Newton](https://twitter.com/d_run), the front-end wizard, helped translate the color functions of Sass (written in Ruby) to Javascript. In a short time, we had just the tool we wanted.

Arc90 released the tool to the world and [quite a few folks found it rather useful](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=sassme.arc90.com):

The project lived in the wild for a few years at `http://sassme.arc90.com` (code was available on Github at [arc90/sass-color-picker](https://github.com/arc90/sass-color-picker)).

Then, one day, I got a tweet from someone asking me if the site was still around. I visited `http://sassme.arc90.com` and found the URL was dead. After reaching out to a few contacts, I found out that the parent company who had acquired Arc90 had gone bankrupt and stopped paying their web hosting fees. As a result, all `arc90.com` related domains had died. Seeing as people still found the tool useful, I resolved to take over the app myself and host it under my domain.

## Version 2.0

I copied the code from Arc90’s repository and immediately put it up under my domain at [http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme](http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme). Shortly thereafter I began rewriting the code to leverage React instead of jQuery. I was able to use a lot of the original math Darren had written for transforming colors, with just a few fine-tuned adjustments here and there to get the colors right (hex color output had been off by a value or two, as mentioned in [this issue](https://github.com/arc90/sass-color-picker/issues/5)) which I was able to resolve (at least I think I did ... nobody’s filed an issue yet).

The whole page got a bit of fresh paint from the design side and within a few weeks I pushed out version 2.0 of SassMe to [http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme](http://jim-nielsen.com/sassme).

It was fun translating this into React project. Using [react-create-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) to setup all my tooling was stellar. I was able to dig right into coding, rather than spend forever configuring. If you haven’t tried react-create-app yet, give it a try! As for SassMe, you can find [the code on Github](https://github.com/jimniels/sassme). Feel free to tweak, adjust, PR, file an issue, whatever. The tool is yours.
