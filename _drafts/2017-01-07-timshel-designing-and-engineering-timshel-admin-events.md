Events index iterations:

1. First iteration, index listing of events
2. Removed a few icons
3. Moved to a single list that is filtereable via a dropdown from  the list label, i.e. "Upcoming events" when you click on reveals a dropdown where you can choose between "Upcoming Events", "Past Events", "All Events", etc., which would redraw the list.
4. Added support for multi-day events.
