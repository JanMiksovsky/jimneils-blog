Yet another post in which you announce a redesign. I got an itch to redesign my blog, which I can scratch because, hey, it’s mine and you can’t tell me what to do.

The thing that inspired me to redesign my blog was, well, to be honest it was kind of fatigue. My blog is basically just a place for me to write about things I want to write about because they either interest me or because I want to learn more about them and writing helps me do that. [@TODO tyler email explaining this] just about reading/writing for me. 

The more I read and write on the web, the more I wish I had those old-school web features like usage of the `:visted` pseudo class in CSS. Why? Because then I could browse the web and actually know what i’ve read/looked at. But hardly anyone uses that anymore. Be the change you want to see in the world right? I'd been reading some of Tim Berners Lee’s notes on the web recently and really enjoyed it because he basic ”web” styles: blue links (purple for visited ones). This made reading his stuff really easy. If it was purple, i'd already read it. It sounds so simple, but it was so nice. It's the small things you know?

One of the things that interested me when I started this redesign was how many times I’ve changed my blog design over the years. Thanks to the [WayBack Machine](@TODO) I could find out. Allow me to take you on a tour:

**Circa November 2011**: ah yes, probably the very first design of my blog. It very much fit the design of a Wordpress blog around the time: content feed on the left, blog categories and tags on the right, posts with featured images, it all brings me back to a simpler time.

**Circa June 2012**: this looks like it was an at attempt at making my blog more “visual”. As you can see, the content previews for the post listings were removed in favor of showing only each post’s featured image. Ah young Jim, did you really think you were going to create a “featured image” for every single blog post? Who do you think you are, an online media company? I’m sure by the time I had three or four blog post drafts, I quickly realized I’d either be 1) rarely publishing anything, due to effort required to create a unique image with every post, or 2) redesigning my blog soon.

**Circa March 2013**: ahhh, I remember this. This was when I switched to the now-defunct service [Scriptogram](@TODO) for hosting my blog. That service was pretty neat. You could publish markdown files to a folder on Dropbox and their service would build your blog for you. In a sense it was really great because I could edit a plain-text markdown file from anywhere and the edits would be live to my blog within a minute or so, all due to Dropbox’s file syncing platform. It was kind of like Jekyll but without the jekyll-ness of it. You have a folder of markdown files representing posts (which take a certain format), we turn it into a blog. The service, however, was free so (as you can imagine) it wasn’t around long. 

This particular screenshot reflects the default theme the service applied to all their blogs. It was fine, it worked for me. Or rather, it worked until I wanted to roll my own design, which fortunately their service did actually allow for. And that leads me to my next picture:

**Circa March 2014**: I actually had this design for a while. I remember thinking it was pretty good. It was a “theme” I developed first when my blog was hosted on Scriptogram. When that service went down, there was this thing called “Jekyll + Github Pages” I decided to give a try. I remember it being relatively easy to transfer all my posts and the site’s theme from scriptogram (markdown posts in dropbox + static CSS theme) to jekyll (markdown posts and HTML/CSS in Github). I think I kept this design longer than others, but eventually the itch to redesign struck again (as it always does).


// @TODO more from github


**March 2018** Ah yes, the redesign of 2018 where you wrote a blog post to go with the new design. What were you thinking back th...oh wait, this is my current design. I’m sure all my rationale (or rather impulse) for this design will be considered “silly” by Jim of 2020, but that’s ok. I’ve learned to live with myself.
