Years ago, [Cameron Moll wrote a post](http://www.cameronmoll.com/archives/001266.html) describing what separates good design from great design. One of the things he talked about which has stuck with me through the years is the idea of treating text as UI. This is most aptly described with an image he used in his presentation:

When desinging applications (which primarily exist to present sets of information dynamically), presenting text as UI (instead of content) aids users because it sets up expectations around information intpretation: “these things are important, these less-so”. You can leverage design principles like sizing, color, and white space to provide an interpretation of the text. This simplifies the cognitive overhead for the user because the interface is providing an interpretation on the text, like what information is important and what information is related (and by what kind of categorization).

## A Real-world Example

When I first started at Insight, one of the first design problems I solved was accomplished by treating text as UI (and not just as content). Let me frame the problem I was given.

Users of the application were provided a new feature allowing them to search system information, based on any data available to them, in order to find the item they were looking for.

However, users reported the following problems with this interface:

1. Functionally the dropdown was a suggestion of key results based on their input (along with a variety of other factors the system knew about them). However, users didn’t appear to realize that the search dropdown was merely a suggestion of results. They thought it was the “full” search results.
2. The search results being returned were comprised of two primary types: quotes and policies. It wasn’t clear by looking at the textual results what kind of thing they were looking at, whether it was a policy or a quote.

Based on this feedback, I took the exisiting search “auto-suggest” UI and came up with this new design:

![New search UI]({{ site.imageurl }}/2016/text-as-ui-new-search.png)

Do you see what I did there? Here’s a quick rundown on the reasoning behind my design choices:

- The dropdown results were prefixed with a label indicating they were suggestions. Then came the results they could click on. Then, finally, came an additional link that communicated: “are these suggestions not what you were looking for? Do a full search.”
- Every result would have a quote number, so every result showed that unique identifier along with a descriptive label. However, not every result would have a policy number, so those unique identifiers were labeled and aligned on the right. This made it easy to scan the right column of the results to differentiate between what was a quote and what was a policy.

This new search results UI treated didn’t treat text as content. The search results weren’t just concatenated as strings of text returned from the server. In fact, for this design to be implemented, the content being returned from the server didn’t even have to change. Instead, I treated the content being returned as textual UI rather than textual content. This provided an interpretation of information that more clearly aligned with users mental model of the data they were interacting with. It made the information more parseable, understandable, and functional.

Here’s a comparison between the old and the new UI:
