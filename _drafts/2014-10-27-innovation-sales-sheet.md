I got a request to take some exisiting copy describing a possible new feautre and turn it into a sales sheet which would be used in 1-on-1 conversations with exisiting clients.

The first step was meeting with the stakeholders and receiving an in-person summary of the intended purpose and goals of the to-be sales sheet, after which I was given access to the exisiting copy in a Google doc. At that point, my first intention was to understand the text.

In reading through the copy, I tried to conceptualize how the text might lend itself to a visual narrative. Between reading and editing, I took my thoughts to paper to try sketching (in broad strokes) the overarching story the text was trying to tell. This required that I take initiative in emphasizing points which were important to the overall goals of the document, while other points were de-emphasized.

Sketching helped lead me to understand how the copy itself could be configured into a narrative consisting of headings, subheadings, paragraphs, bullet points, and images. Granted, I had to inject a lot of my own interpretation into how this document should be presented, how the story should be told. This meant I’d have to reconvene with the stakeholders to ensure my interpreations of the text, both textually and conceptually, were in sync with their own vision.

To do this, I started making my ideas a little more concrete by wireframing my sketches. This meant emphasizing certain parts of the text as headers and de-emphasizing others into paragraphs or summarized bullet points. This resulted in a low-fidelity document I could show to stakeholders to ensure they were onboard with the direction I was taking.

The reaction from the stakeholders was positive and they were on board with my direction and interpretation of the initial text.

With all the stakeholders, a solid visual prototype, and the text edited to lend itself to visual aids, I started getting into more fine-tuned visual details.

Rather than use concrete screenshots of the product altered to fit our “theoretical” new feature, I instead created a looser visual interpretation as to what the feature might look like. Because the details of the feature had not been worked out yet, actual screenshots of the product wouldn't serve as an accurate representations or descriptions of what the feature could be. By using a more open-ended visual solution, exisiting clients could more easily understand the functions and goals of the new feature without getting hung up on the details of implementation (this held true for empoloyees of the company as well). The idea of the feature was still very much in its infancy, so tying it down to a rigid visual interpetation at such an early, conceptual stage didn’t make very much sense (though it was the stakeholders initial conception of the document).
