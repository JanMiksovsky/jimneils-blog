There's this thing called QQS

1. Enter an address
2. Choose an auto-suggested address
3. This gives us enough info to provide a quote based on a carrier (given the user's preferences)

After release, the problem we discovered is that the addresses being entered by some users were not showing up in the autocomplete. We *thought* we had properly accounted for this edge case during the design phase by providing an action in the case of 0 auto-suggested addresses. This action allowed informed the user he or she could continue to get a quote by entering the state of the property rather than the address.

However, what we discovered once we rolled this out to production was that some users could not get 

1. Hit Google’s place autocomplete API, which allows you to enter a natural lannguage address and get back the component pars of an address (verified through Google), i.e. "760 E 3rd Ave Salt Lake City" will give you back "address: 760 E 3rd Ave; city: Salt Lake City; state: UT; zip: 84103" broken into their respective pieces for ease of handling from a programatic perspective.
2. Using the address given back by Google, we would then hit the geocoding API to get the lat/long values for a particular property. 

The problem was, we found, that sometimes users couldn't find their address through step 1 but their address would be found through step 2. I will spare the technical details of how this is possible, but suffice it to say that it happened more frequently than you would think. For example, many times when people are getting insurance they are doing it on a newer property which may not be in a system like Google’s (yet).

What we decided to do was allow the user to fully enter an address and do a manual search for it. So if you started typing in an address and you saw yours come up in the autosuggest, you would choose it, which then does steps 1 and 2. But if you didn't see your address show up, you could still enter your full address and then do a manual search (step 2).
