I was recently browsing through my recommended reads on Readability and I stumbled on this:

 Usually when [thegaw](https://twitter.com/thegaw) recommends something to read, it’s worth reading. If he recommends something worth printing and taping to every wall in my office, well it’s probably pretty good.

The article is titled *[How to be a Great Developer](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6)* and is written by Ed Finkler (a.k.a. [funkatraon](https://twitter.com/funkatron)). There are a lot of really good insights in the article, I suggest you [take a look]((https://the-pastry-box-project.net/ed-finkler/2014-january-6)). However, I want to focus on one particular point made in the article:

> Don’t worry about how many people use what you make. Empowering 5 people is incredibly special. They will remember what you did for them.

Personally, I’ve never created anything (that I know of) which has been seen and used by millions people. I have, however, [created](http://jim-nielsen.com/#recent-projects) and [written](http://jim-nielsen.com/#published-articles) a few things seen by a few people. I generally have no idea how my handiworks have been perceived by others. I simply hope their experiences with them have been pleasant. 

However, occasionally I get small insights into how my projects are received and experienced. One example is [teamcolors](http://teamcolors.arc90.com/), a weekend hackathon project I pieced together when I worked at Arc90. It’s a simple compilation of HEX color values for professional sport teams.
