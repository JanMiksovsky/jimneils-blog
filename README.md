# My Blog

Working through the idea of switching my blog over to github pages ... in development ....

## `gh-pages` Branch
I only have the single branch `gh-pages` (master is deleted). I did this following instructions [here][http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/#deleting-master].


## To-Do
- Feed images
- Update scriptogram theme to point to new blog
- Next / Prev Posts at the end of a post (read next)
