# My Blog

Working through the idea of switching my blog over to github pages ... in development ....

## `gh-pages` Branch
I only have the single branch `gh-pages` (master is deleted). I did this following instructions [here][http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/#deleting-master].

## Tags

I keep track of tags manually, as I know of no other way currently. So, in the folder `/tags` I just need to keep track of what tags I'm using on the site. I want to restrict myself for easy search/find. Currently, these are the tags in the system:

1. published-articles
2. web-design
3. insights
4. notes
5. tips
6. case-study
7. resources
8. typography

## To-Do
- Feed images
- Update scriptogram theme to point to new blog
- Next / Prev Posts at the end of a post
