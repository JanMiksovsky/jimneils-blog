# My Blog

Working through the idea of switching my blog over to github pages ... in development ....

## `gh-pages` Branch
I only have the single branch `gh-pages` (master is deleted). I did this following instructions [here][http://oli.jp/2011/github-pages-workflow/#deleting-master].

## Tags

I keep track of tags manually, as I know of no other way currently. So, in the folder `/tags` I just need to keep track of what tags I'm using on the site. I want to restrict myself for easy search/find. Currently, these are the tags in the system:

- published-articles
- web-design
- insights
- notes
- tags
- tips
