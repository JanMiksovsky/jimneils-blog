Or, "how to revivie the old dropbox public folder"

Or, "how to use netlify as an FTP but also a global CDN"

Ways I tried:

- script editor that launches terminal script
- bitbar that has a shortcut to launching terminal script
- daemon that watches files in background and launches terminal script (sends notification)
- bitbar that runs every couple seconds with local index of files and checks for changes
