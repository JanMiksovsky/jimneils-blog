title: From React to Web Components to Vanilla JS

Been thinking about the `/search` experience on my icon gallery sites...because I use React to something that, on the face of it, seemed relatively rather simple. 


Web components have been on my radar for a while, so I figured i'd give that a try. What if i come up with a (relatively) declarative set of code that ran that interactions on the page but do it without a framework? How much could would that save me shipping to the client? Turns out it was a lot of lines of code.

Granted what you see in the screenshot is 

How did I get to this point in time where I’m writing this blog post? Glad you asked.

## In the Beginning, There Was React

When I first build the `/search` page for my icon gallery sites, I wanted to have some kind of interactive experience where you could search through icons based on their metadata. Want to see all icons tagged “blue”? Want to see all icons by the designer “Michael Flarup”? I wanted the UI to allow for it.

I didn’t have—nor did I know how or want to setup—a server for handling this kind of search/filtering. But I knew React. I’d built a few things similar to this with React and because it was the hammer I knew, I used the hammer. Makes sense. React was how I learned to build dynamic web application UIs. So when I needed to build one, what did I turn to? React. 

But it was overkill. I wanted to try something different.

## Then Came Web Components

Why? Web components are native. They allow you to write the same kind of declarative component you'd use in something like react, but you don't have to ship the framework for handling it to the end user. It's native to the user. Fantastic right?

Not so fast. [Medium article on the matter]()

### Problematic Thinking: UI as a Function of State

#### Implicit State: Input[type=text]

Once I get ride of search and just have radios, I can still

TK: this is actually because of how react components by default want to be mounted/unmounted, while working with DOM you want to generally show/hide, but keep stuff in the DOM. You could do this with react, but you'd actually be mounting all of them in the DOM, show/hide the "visible" one but keep the state of each. UI=F(STATE) here really 

What happens if you have “tabs” and inside of each of those tabs you have state? React unmounts the component and at that point, everything that was in there, is gone. Granted there’s ways around this, but let me show you a simple example.

In the case like mine, I had two sets of state: 1) an active filter category, and 2) an active value from a filter category. Think of it like the ability to choose a car make, then based on the make you selected, you are then presented with a list of models within that make which you can choose.

- Ford 
  - 
  - Escape
  - Expedition
- Toyota
  - Camry
  - Rav4
  - Highlander
- Honda
  - Civic
  - CR-V
  - Pilot

In the above, you can only ever presented with the option to choose a second level tier of options by first choosing its associated top tier. Ford::Expedition, Honda::CR-V, those are valid selections. Toyota::Civic is not.

In React, that means you need to keep track of two pieces of state: the active category and the active category's value.

As you click around and make selections, the browser is keeping track of those selections for you because the state is in the DOM.

If I choose “Ford”, which sub-selection will be active? None? The first one? In React, you choose. Let’s say we choose to make the first option always the active selected choice by default. If I choose “Ford”, “XXX” will be first. If I select “Toyota”, “Camry” will be first. If I switch back to “Ford”, “XXX” will be selected.

Ah, but there’s the subtle difference with the state being in the DOM. When working with DOM, i’ll probably just leave all of those items in the DOM.

But in React, you have to choose how to handle that state. 

So what happens when you choose a category and a category value, then a different category, then switch back to the first?

## Lastly I Resolved to Vanilla JS

As you saw with the web component, because my client-side JS must contain all the rendering logic for the application, I end up in a place where I have to have data (a big JSON file) and then logic for rendering that data to the screen (web component file).

But what if I moved all of that logic to server? One benefit is that i'm already doing that rendering logic on the server. I'm using it to render all the other icons lists on other pages. So that allows me to take advantage of writing the logic once and using it everywhere. Preiouvsly I had to duplciate the logic/markup that renders those files.

So, what I end up with is a bunch of client-side code written in javascript which fetches data, renders that data to the screen, and handles events which respond to user interactions. What I could have is all that data embedded in the HTML already. Then I don't need the templates (everything is in the DOM in the form of HTML) or data (its also in the markup, in the form of things like attributes). The only thing I need is a couple javascript instructions to setup interactivity. 


```js
// Get the JSON data from somewhere
const icons = fetch('/path/to/data.json').then(res => res.json())
// -> [{ title: "Foo", category: "601" }, { title: "Bar", category: "602" }];

// Setup interaction logic via listeners, etc.
document.querySelector("input").addEventListener("click", () => {})
// more...

// The rendering logic/template which converts the data to HTML
// and sticks it in the DOM.
const render = () = {
  myelement.innerHtml = data
    .filter(item => item.category === state.category)
    .map(item => `<li>${item.title}</li>`)
    .join("")
  // more...
}
```

![screenshot of the JSON ]()

Instead, I essentially do the first two things on the server via markup. By the time the HTML gets to the client, everything I need to work with is already in the DOM. At that point, all I need is the interaction logic and listeners

```js
// DOM already contains the data and proper markup, i.e.
//   <li data-category="601">Foo</li>
//   <li data-category="602">Bar</li>
// So all we need is:

// Setup interaction logic via listeners, etc.
document.querySelector("input").addEventListener("click", () => {})
// more...
```


## Conclusion

I know this seems like all I’m saying is “let’s do web development like it’s 2011.” And I guess I am saying that, at least for some circumstances. Not only does what I described above result in a better experience to the end user because my page is lighter (no framework) and leaner (less JavaScript to parse), but I actually think it’s easier to understand and maintain as a code project. 

So the advantage of what I ended up with over previous versions—which used React and Web Components—really boils down to this: less JavaScript is shipped to the end user, saving both 1) bandwidth because of file size, and 2) CPU cycles because there’s less JavaScript to parse.
