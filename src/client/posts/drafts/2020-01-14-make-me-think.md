Remember that book “Don’t Make Me Think”? 

Well, that’s what our UIs have done to society: they’ve made us not think.

There’s this thing called [the cognitive reflection test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_reflection_test) (or CRT) which is a test “designed to measure a person’s tendency to override an incorrect ‘gut’ response and engage in further reflection to find a correct answer.”

> According to Frederick, there are two general types of cognitive activity called "system 1" and "system 2" (these terms have been first used by Daniel Kahneman). System 1 is executed quickly without reflection, while system 2 requires conscious thought and effort. The cognitive reflection test has three questions that each have an obvious but incorrect response given by system 1. The correct response requires the activation of system 2. For system 2 to be activated, a person must note that their first answer is incorrect, which requires reflection on their own cognition

Here are the three questions:

1. A bat and a ball cost $1.10 in total. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?
2. If it takes 5 machines 5 minutes to make 5 widgets, how long would it take 100 machines to make 100 widgets?
3. In a lake, there is a patch of lily pads. Every day, the patch doubles in size. If it takes 48 days for the patch to cover the entire lake, how long would it take for the patch to cover half of the lake?

Intuitive answers are: 1) 10 cents, 2) 100 minutes, and 3) 24 days. The correct answers are: 1) 5 cents, 2) 5 minutes, and 3) 47 days.

What’s interesting, Malcolm Gladwell points out in his book “David and Goliath”, is that there is actually an easy way to raise people’s grades on this test: make the test questions hard to read.

> The psychologists Adam Alter and Daniel Oppenheimer tried this a few years ago with a group of undergraduates at Princeton University. First they gave the CRT the normal way, and the students averaged 1.9 correct answers out of three. That’s pretty good, though it is well short of the 2.18 that MIT students averaged. Then Alter and Oppenheimer printed out the test questions in a font that was really hard to read—a 10 percent gray, 10-point italics Myriad Pro font...

Translated to digital, that would mean a question that looked roughly like this:

What happened?

> The average score this time around? 2.45. Suddenly, the students were doing much better than their counterparts at

Wait, but I thought we were supposed to not make people think? Present things to them clearly and simply and they’ll do better. But the opposite happened here. The typographic treatment of the question made reading difficult. You probably had to squint, maybe even read some of the words (or the entire question) multiple times. Interacting with the question made you stop and think. It made you _work_. 

Gladwell comments on this interesting result of the study:

> As Alter says, making the questions “disfluent” causes people to “think more deeply about whatever they come across. They’ll use more resources on it. They’ll process more deeply or think more carefully about what’s going on. If they have to overcome a hurdle, they’ll overcome it better when you force them to think a little harder.” Alter and Oppenheimer made the CRT more difficult. But that difficulty turned out to be _desirable_.


## Limbo Excerpts

There was this product called [Limbo](https://www.limbo.io/), which was an “anonymous job platform for your ideal next role.”

> [Me] Creating a profile really made me think about what I've done and what I'd like to do. I probably thought harder about that when creating a profile than most any other time in my life ha, which made the "take a break" part of the profile really great. I still ended up just filling out things real fast because I wanted to just do a quick pass through of the app, but I think the questions / content were really great.
> [Tyler] We heard that same feedback from the other person who tried it out. I'm loving that part of it. I think we're gonna try to encourage that even more.


More of me:
> I gave the app another spin tonight by creating another quick profile. Honestly, if I were to really put a profile out there, I realize that I'd really need to sit down and think about:
>
> 1. What do I want? And not just a general "what do I want out of life?" but a very precise set of details "I want to be doing *this* kind of work, on *this* kind of team, with *this* kind of business" etc. etc. 
> 2. What are my credentials? This ties very much to the first question in that I'd need to take time to think about what kind of experience I have but not just generally. What kind of experience do I have that supports or lends credence to the very specific kind of role I want.
>
> I know I've mentioned this, but I feel like the app does a *REALLY* good job of making me stop and thinking about myself and what I want. I really like that it gives me the flexibility to mold my future job desire with my past experience. The ability to put out multiple profiles that are tailored precisely to different things I might want (or think I'm good at). Most of the time it's like "yeah I do web stuff. You need web stuff done at your company? Ok I can figure out whatever you need" type of deal. And it's cool that you could go that broad with Limbo or you could go to the other end of the spectrum in precise details.

> tldr; of the above: really good job on the way the app makes me think. I found myself multiple times thinking "this is too hard. you people who made this app, you're making me think too much" but then an inner voice said "hey stupid, this stuff that's hard, It's for YOU. It's for YOUR benefit. Are you telling me you don't want to work hard for YOURSELF? You get what you put into it." and then I was like "ok I'll spend whatever amount of time this takes".

Tyler:

> And we're hearing similar things from other folks. I'm a little scared we're gonna lose people because it is difficult, but that might be OK? It's the antithesis of most internet things these days. Instead of go-go-go, fast-fast, more-more, we're asking both candidates and recruiters to slow down, take their time. Based on your feedback I think we'll lean into that even more. We'll likely make more changes to the Profile form and throughout the site to encourage folks take time and think about what they really want. Just reiterate as much as we can that it's OK to not know immediately. It's OK that it's hard.
