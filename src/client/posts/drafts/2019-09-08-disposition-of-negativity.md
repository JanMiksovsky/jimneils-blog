# Being Conscious of My Disposition Towards Negativity

I've been a dad for about four years now and there’s an interesting...what should I call it...phenomenon that occurs amongst the cult of parents. It's what I'm going to refer to as an "unmindful disposition of negativity" towards their children. What do I mean by this?

All parents seem to share an unspoken but shared bond of pain as a result of their children. Sleepless nights. A lack of "me" time. Changes to your martial relationship. Loss of patience. They're money pits. I'm sure the list could go on.


Question your motives. Question what you’re telling yourself. Is that actually true? Do you really feel that way? A lot of the times you’re not. You’ll discover “hey I don’t actually hate my kids, so why do I say these things”. Is it just because they are the things that are at the forefront? Are they always screaming? Always complaining? No. Sure they do a lot. But I’m the moment you say it it’s probably because that’s what you’re feeling at that moment, probably because they were just screaming or complains. Ask yourself: is this really true?




Having kids completely changes your life. At least it did mine. And so when you talk with other parents, you bond over their shared trail by fire.
